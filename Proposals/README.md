# Proposals Directory

**Strategic proposal exploration and approval tracking for the Axiom Framework ecosystem**

## üéØ Purpose

This directory contains isolated strategic proposals for improving the Axiom Framework, AxiomTestApp, and development processes. Proposals are generated via `@PROPOSE` and integrated via `@APPROVE <proposal-file>`.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### **Active/** - Current Proposals Under Consideration
Contains proposals that are actively being considered for approval. These are generated by `@PROPOSE` and await `@APPROVE <proposal-file>` integration.

**File Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-descriptive-name.md`

### **Approved/** - Approved Proposals Being Implemented  
Contains proposals that have been approved via `@APPROVE` and are being implemented in the development roadmap.

### **Archive/** - Historical Proposals
- **2024/**, **2025/**, etc. - Yearly organization of completed proposals
- **deprecated/** - Proposals that are no longer relevant

### **Templates/** - Standard Proposal Templates
- `framework-enhancement.md` - Template for framework improvement proposals
- `process-improvement.md` - Template for development process proposals  
- `strategic-vision.md` - Template for strategic vision and direction proposals

### **Analysis/** - Supporting Analysis Files
- `current-state-assessment.md` - Latest comprehensive system analysis
- `performance-benchmarks.md` - Performance analysis and comparison data
- `competitive-analysis.md` - External framework and ecosystem analysis

## üîÑ Workflow

### **1. Generate Proposals**
```bash
@PROPOSE  # Creates proposals in Active/ directory
```

### **2. Review and Approve**
```bash
@APPROVE 2025-01-01-example-proposal.md  # Integrates specific proposal
```

### **3. Implementation Tracking**
Approved proposals are automatically added to ROADMAP.md priorities and relevant documentation is updated.

## üìã Proposal Categories

### **Framework Enhancement**
- API design improvements
- Performance optimizations
- New capability implementations
- Module reorganization

### **Test App Enhancement**  
- Integration testing improvements
- Validation methodology enhancements
- Developer experience demonstrations
- Performance measurement upgrades

### **Process Improvement**
- Development workflow optimizations
- Terminal coordination enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Strategic alignment refinements

### **Strategic Vision**
- Long-term framework direction
- Revolutionary capability development
- Community preparation
- Ecosystem evolution planning

## üéØ Proposal Quality Standards

Each proposal must include:
- **Clear Problem Statement** - What specific issue or opportunity is being addressed
- **Detailed Solution** - Comprehensive description of the proposed improvement
- **Quantified Benefits** - Measurable improvements and impact analysis
- **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step approach with dependencies
- **Risk Assessment** - Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Success Metrics** - How success will be measured and validated

## üîÑ Multi-Terminal Integration

### **Conflict-Free Exploration**
- Proposals directory is isolated from active development
- `@PROPOSE` can run while Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 are working
- Strategic thinking happens without disrupting framework or test app development

### **Controlled Integration** 
- `@APPROVE` carefully integrates proposals into roadmap and documentation
- Only affects documentation and roadmap, never source code directly
- Implementation coordinated through normal terminal workflow

### **Terminal Coordination**
- **Terminal 1 (Main)**: Generates and approves proposals
- **Terminal 2 (Development)**: Implements framework-related approved proposals  
- **Terminal 3 (Integration)**: Implements test app-related approved proposals

## üìä Current Status

**Active Proposals**: [Updated automatically by @PROPOSE]
**Approved Proposals**: [Updated automatically by @APPROVE]  
**Implementation Pipeline**: [Tracked in ROADMAP.md]
