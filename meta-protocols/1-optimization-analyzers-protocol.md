# OPTIMIZATION-ANALYZERS-PROTOCOL

Parallel analysis actors focused on performance optimizations and native platform enhancements to improve codebase quality and efficiency.

## Activation
```
ultrathink . run protocol @OPTIMIZATION_ACTOR <codebase_directory> [context_file]
```

*Note: The codebase directory contains the source code to analyze. Optional context file provides additional context about the codebase. Analyses are read from and written to the current working directory. IMPORTANT: Read the full content of existing analyses to understand previous insights, not just filenames.*

## Process
1. **Context** - Read context file (if provided) to understand performance requirements, platform constraints, and optimization priorities
2. **Discover** - Read and analyze content of existing analyses in current working directory (if any) to understand what optimizations have been identified and what performance gaps remain unaddressed
3. **Modern Language Analysis** - Analyze current codebase for opportunities to leverage modern native language features over custom implementations
4. **Custom vs Native Assessment** - Identify custom data structures, algorithms, and concurrency implementations that could be replaced with superior native language features
5. **Performance Profiling** - Use Task tool to systematically analyze codebase for performance bottlenecks, memory inefficiencies, and opportunities to leverage native optimizations
6. **Implementation Analysis** - Read actual source files to understand current custom implementations and evaluate native language alternatives that provide better performance and maintainability
7. **Optimization Identification** - Choose the most impactful unexplored performance improvement leveraging native language features over custom solutions
8. **Native Platform Analysis** - Identify platform-specific optimizations and native API usage opportunities that improve performance and integration
9. **Native Language Solutions** - Create optimized implementations prioritizing native language features over custom implementations for superior performance and reliability
10. **Document** - Create uniquely-named analysis report: `OPTIMIZATION-{TIMESTAMP}-{SCOPE}.md` in the current working directory

## Outputs
- Performance-focused analysis prioritizing native language features over custom implementations for data structures, algorithms, and concurrency
