# Axiom Test Application Development Tracking

Proposal progress tracking for test application and framework integration validation

## Application Development Focus

**Purpose**: Track current proposal progress across development sessions
**Scope**: AxiomTestApp features, user experience, validation scenarios
**Objective**: Monitor proposal implementation progress and development findings

### ðŸ”„ **Standardized Git Workflow**
All ApplicationProtocols commands follow this workflow:
1. **Branch Setup**: Switch to `application` branch (create if doesn't exist)
2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `application` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `application` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `application` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `application` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Current Application Status

### AxiomTestApp Implementation
- **iOS Application**: Application demonstrating framework integration
- **Multi-Domain Architecture**: User, Data, Analytics domains implemented
- **Interactive Features**: Framework capability demonstrations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics collection and validation
- **Usage Examples**: Basic, streamlined, and advanced usage patterns

### Framework Integration Status
- **Actor Integration**: UserClient, DataClient, AnalyticsClient implementation
- **Context Orchestration**: Multi-domain context coordination
- **SwiftUI Binding**: Reactive view updates with defined relationships
- **Capability Validation**: Runtime checking with degradation handling
- **Intelligence Queries**: Natural language architectural query interface
- **Performance Tracking**: Integrated metrics collection and analysis


## Success Metrics

### User Experience Targets
- **App Launch Time**: Optimized startup performance
- **Navigation Speed**: Responsive navigation between screens
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal battery consumption
- **User Satisfaction**: Usability validation

### Framework Validation Targets
- **API Usage**: Demonstrate major framework APIs
- **Performance Validation**: Framework performance measurement
- **Developer Experience**: Development productivity assessment
- **Use Case Coverage**: Business use case implementation
- **Integration Validation**: Framework integration testing

## ðŸ”„ **Application Development Workflow**

### **Command Execution Cycle**
```bash
# Standard Development Cycle (5 Steps)
1. ApplicationProtocols/PLAN.md      # Read TRACKING.md priorities â†’ Create proposals
2. ApplicationProtocols/DEVELOP.md   # Implement proposals â†’ Update TRACKING.md progress
3. ApplicationProtocols/CHECKPOINT.md # Merge to main â†’ Update TRACKING.md completion
4. ApplicationProtocols/REFACTOR.md  # Structural improvements â†’ Update TRACKING.md quality
5. ApplicationProtocols/CHECKPOINT.md # Final merge â†’ Fresh cycle â†’ Update TRACKING.md
```

### **Command Separation of Concerns**
- **PLAN**: Reads TRACKING.md current priorities â†’ Creates structured application proposals
- **DEVELOP**: Implements proposals â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with implementation progress
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow management â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with merge completion
- **REFACTOR**: Code organization improvements â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with quality metrics
- **TRACKING**: Central progress coordination â†’ Updated by all commands

### **TRACKING.md Integration**
All commands integrate with TRACKING.md:
- **Read Operations**: PLAN.md reads current priorities and focuses development
- **Write Operations**: DEVELOP.md, CHECKPOINT.md, REFACTOR.md update progress and completion
- **Coordination**: TRACKING.md maintains current state across all development sessions
