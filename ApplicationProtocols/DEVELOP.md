# @DEVELOP.md - Axiom Application Development Command

Application development command with methodology, requirements, and execution procedures

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@DEVELOP [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute application development workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@DEVELOP`** → Auto-detect current context and execute application development workflow
- **`@DEVELOP plan`** → Plan application development tasks and priorities
- **`@DEVELOP build`** → Execute application build and testing cycle
- **`@DEVELOP test`** → Run application testing suite
- **`@DEVELOP validate`** → Application validation and integration testing

### Application Development Scope
**Application Focus**: Test application development, framework integration validation, user experience implementation
**Quality Standards**: High test coverage with comprehensive success rates
**Integration**: Integration with @PLAN, @CHECKPOINT, and application development workflows

### 🔄 **Test-Driven Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: DEVELOP commands NEVER perform git operations (commit/push/merge)
**Version Control**: Only @CHECKPOINT commands handle all git operations
**Work Philosophy**: DEVELOP implements code → Multiple DEVELOP/REFACTOR cycles → @CHECKPOINT commits and merges

TDD-enforced development workflow (NO git operations):
1. **Test-First Development**: Write failing tests before any implementation work
2. **Implementation**: Execute implementation to make tests pass
3. **Test Validation**: MANDATORY - All tests must pass before any work completion
4. **Quality Gate Validation**: ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - 100% test success rate
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update application documentation and integration guides
6. **TRACKING.md Progress Update**: Update implementation progress tracking
**No Git Operations**: DEVELOP commands never commit, push, or merge

## Application Development Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Application development focuses on building test applications that demonstrate framework capabilities through practical implementation and user experience validation.

**Test-Driven Development Philosophy**: ALL application development MUST follow TDD methodology - tests written first, implementation follows, refactoring with passing tests.

**Quality Standards**: Application components maintain framework integration patterns, provide good user experience, and validate framework capabilities through real-world usage.

**Testing Requirements**: Application development targets 100% test success rate with comprehensive test coverage. See `AxiomTestApp/Documentation/Testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` for testing requirements and standards.

**Development Focus**: Application development implements features that demonstrate framework capabilities through user interfaces, business logic implementation, and integration validation.

**Code Integrity**: ZERO TOLERANCE for broken tests in main branch - development process designed to prevent test failures from reaching production.

## Application Development Principles

### Framework Integration

**Integration**: Testing requirements integrated into application development workflow

## 🚨 MANDATORY Test Requirements

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: 100% test success rate for ANY commit to main branch - NO EXCEPTIONS
**TDD ENFORCEMENT**: All application development MUST follow test-driven development methodology
**BLOCKING BEHAVIOR**: Test failures IMMEDIATELY halt ALL application development work until resolved
**Quality Gate**: NO code reaches main branch without passing ALL tests
**Resolution Process**: STOP EVERYTHING → identify cause → fix failure → verify ALL tests pass → continue
**Pre-Commit Validation**: Every commit MUST run complete test suite
**Pre-Merge Validation**: Every merge to main MUST pass complete test suite
**Standards**: Testing requirements in `AxiomTestApp/Documentation/Testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`

## 🔬 Test-Driven Development Methodology

**TDD Cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)**:
1. **RED**: Write a failing test that describes the desired functionality
2. **GREEN**: Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code while keeping all tests passing
4. **REPEAT**: Continue cycle for each new feature or change

**TDD Enforcement Rules**:
- **NEVER write production code without a failing test first**
- **NEVER write more test code than sufficient to make a test fail**
- **NEVER write more production code than sufficient to make the test pass**
- **ALL tests must pass before ANY commit to application branch**
- **ALL tests must pass before ANY merge to main branch**

**Quality Gate Automation**:
```bash
# Pre-commit hook (automatically enforced)
if ! xcodebuild test -scheme ExampleApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -quiet; then
    echo "❌ COMMIT BLOCKED: Tests must pass before commit"
    exit 1
fi

# Pre-merge validation (automatically enforced)
if ! xcodebuild test -scheme ExampleApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -quiet; then
    echo "❌ MERGE BLOCKED: Tests must pass before merge to main"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Application Development Success Criteria

**Standards**: Success criteria in `AxiomTestApp/Documentation/Development/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md`

## Application Development Execution Loop

**Command**: `@DEVELOP [plan|build|test|validate]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive application development workflow with methodology enforcement

### 🔄 **Test-Driven Development Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: DEVELOP commands work on current branch state - NO git operations

```bash
# Test-driven development workflow (NO git operations)
echo "🧪 MANDATORY: Running complete test suite validation..."
cd AxiomExampleApp
if ! xcodebuild test -scheme ExampleApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -quiet; then
    echo "❌ CRITICAL: Tests are failing on current branch"
    echo "🚨 BLOCKING: All development work MUST stop until tests pass"
    echo "🔧 Required action: Fix failing tests before proceeding"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Test suite passed - safe to proceed with TDD application development"
echo "📍 Working on current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "⚠️ Version control managed by @CHECKPOINT only"
cd ..
```

**Test-Driven Automated Execution Process**:
1. **Test Suite Validation** → MANDATORY - Run complete test suite and verify 100% pass rate
2. **Planning Integration** → Reference current TRACKING application priorities and @PLAN outputs
3. **TDD Methodology Enforcement** → Apply test-driven development principles and framework integration patterns
4. **Test-First Development** → Write failing tests before any implementation work
5. **Implementation Cycle** → Implement minimal code to make tests pass
6. **Test Validation** → MANDATORY - All tests must pass before work completion
7. **Build and Test Cycle** → Execute application build, test with coverage requirements
8. **Quality Gate Validation** → ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - 100% test success rate before any progression
9. **Documentation Updates** → Update application documentation and integration guides
10. **TRACKING.md Progress Update** → Update implementation progress in ApplicationProtocols/TRACKING.md
11. **Coordination Updates** → Provide progress updates and framework validation results
**No Git Operations**: All version control handled by @CHECKPOINT commands only

**Test-Driven Application Development Execution Examples**:
- `@DEVELOP plan` → Plan application development priorities with test-first approach
- `@DEVELOP build` → Execute TDD cycle: write tests → implement → validate
- `@DEVELOP test` → Run comprehensive application testing with 100% pass requirement
