## Application Development Reset Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Application reset creates clean development environments that eliminate development conflicts, provide fresh starting points, and ensure clean application development cycles.

**Reset Purpose**: Application reset provides clean development environment initialization for application development teams working on complex feature implementations and framework integration validation.

**Environment Standards**: Application reset ensures clean development environments with proper branch isolation, eliminated development conflicts, and fresh application development foundation.

### üîÑ **Reset Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: RESET commands handle branch management operations for clean environment creation

```bash
# Application environment analysis
echo "üîç Analyzing current application development environment..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "üìç Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Application branch cleanup
echo "üßπ Application environment cleanup..."
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "application" ]; then
    echo "üîÑ Switching from application branch to main..."
    git checkout main
fi

# Delete existing application branch
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/application; then
    echo "üóëÔ∏è Deleting existing application branch..."
    git branch -D application 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "‚úÖ Local application branch deleted"
fi

# Delete remote application branch
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/application; then
    echo "üóëÔ∏è Deleting remote application branch..."
    git push origin --delete application 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "‚úÖ Remote application branch deleted"
fi

# Create fresh application branch
echo "üå± Creating fresh application branch..."
git checkout -b application
echo "‚úÖ Fresh application branch created and active"

# Application reset validation
echo "üîç Validating application reset environment..."
echo "üìç Active branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "‚úÖ Application development environment reset complete"
```
