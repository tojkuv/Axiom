# @EXPLORE.md - Axiom Application Exploration Command

Application exploration command that analyzes, explains, and reasons about application components

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@EXPLORE [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute application exploration workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@EXPLORE`** ‚Üí Explore current application context and provide comprehensive analysis
- **`@EXPLORE analyze`** ‚Üí Deep analysis of specific application components or integration patterns
- **`@EXPLORE explain`** ‚Üí Explain application features, user experience, and framework integration
- **`@EXPLORE reason`** ‚Üí Reason about application design decisions and user experience choices
- **`@EXPLORE validate`** ‚Üí Explore and validate application framework integration and functionality

### Application Exploration Scope
**Exploration Focus**: Application component analysis, framework integration reasoning, user experience explanation
**Branch Independence**: Works on current branch - no git operations performed
**Analysis Creation**: Provides detailed application analysis and explanations for user understanding
**Integration Focus**: Analyzes framework integration patterns and application architecture

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: EXPLORE commands NEVER perform git operations (commit/push/merge)
**Version Control**: Only @CHECKPOINT commands handle all git operations
**Work Philosophy**: EXPLORE analyzes and explains ‚Üí Understanding gained ‚Üí Other workflows implement changes

Work commands operate on current branch without version control:
1. **Analysis**: Read application components and framework integration implementation
2. **Exploration**: Deep dive into application patterns and integration decisions
3. **Explanation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of application behavior
4. **Reasoning**: Analyze integration choices and user experience decisions
**No Git Operations**: EXPLORE commands never commit, push, or merge

## Application Exploration Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Application exploration provides deep analysis and understanding of application components, framework integration patterns, and user experience implementation to support informed development decisions and knowledge transfer.

**Exploration Workflow**: @EXPLORE analyzes application components ‚Üí Provides detailed explanations ‚Üí Supports informed development decisions ‚Üí Knowledge documented for team understanding

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **EXPLORE**: Analyzes and explains application components ‚Üí NO implementation changes
- **PLAN**: Creates proposals based on exploration insights ‚Üí NO direct analysis
- **DEVELOP**: Implements based on understanding ‚Üí NO exploratory analysis
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow ‚Üí NO exploration or analysis
- **TRACKING**: Progress tracking ‚Üí NO component analysis

**Quality Standards**: Application exploration provides comprehensive technical analysis, integration reasoning, and implementation explanations

**Technical Focus Only**: Exploration strictly focuses on technical analysis and understanding. No consideration of non-technical aspects (community involvement, adoption, marketing, business strategy, user engagement, etc.)

## Application Exploration Command Execution

**Command**: `@EXPLORE [analyze|explain|reason|validate]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive application exploration workflow with detailed analysis

### üîÑ **Exploration Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: EXPLORE commands work on current branch state - NO git operations

```bash
# Navigate to application workspace
echo "üîÑ Entering application development workspace..."
cd application-workspace/ || {
    echo "‚ùå Application workspace not found"
    echo "üí° Run '@WORKSPACE setup' to initialize worktrees"
    exit 1
}

# Exploration workflow (NO git operations)
echo "üîç Application Exploration Execution"
echo "üìç Workspace: $(pwd)"
echo "üåø Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "üîó Framework access: AxiomFramework-dev ‚Üí ../framework-workspace/AxiomFramework"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Version control managed by @CHECKPOINT only"
echo "üîç Exploration ready - proceeding in application workspace"
```

**Automated Exploration Process**:
1. **Application Context Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze current application implementation and component state
2. **Component Deep Dive** ‚Üí Examine specific application components and their framework integration
3. **Integration Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze framework integration patterns and usage approaches
4. **User Experience Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze user interface implementation and interaction patterns
