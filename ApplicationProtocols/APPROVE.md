# @APPROVE.md - Axiom Application Proposal Approval Command

Application proposal approval command that accepts proposals and prepares development cycles

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@APPROVE [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute application proposal approval workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@APPROVE`** ‚Üí Approve available application proposals in AxiomExampleApp/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
- **`@APPROVE proposal`** ‚Üí Approve specific application proposal by name
- **`@APPROVE review`** ‚Üí Review and approve application proposals after validation
- **`@APPROVE batch`** ‚Üí Approve multiple application proposals in sequence

### Application Approval Scope
**Approval Focus**: Application proposal acceptance and development cycle preparation
**Branch Independence**: Works on current branch - no git operations performed
**Proposal Processing**: Processes application proposals from WaitingApproval/ directory
**Development Integration**: Prepares approved proposals for ApplicationProtocols/DEVELOP.md implementation

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: APPROVE commands NEVER perform git operations (commit/push/merge)
**Version Control**: Only @CHECKPOINT commands handle all git operations
**Work Philosophy**: APPROVE accepts proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md priorities ‚Üí DEVELOP implements ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT commits

Work commands operate on current branch without version control:
1. **Proposal Analysis**: Read available proposals from AxiomExampleApp/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
2. **Approval Processing**: Accept proposals and prepare for implementation
3. **TRACKING.md Updates**: Update application development priorities and next actions
4. **Development Preparation**: Prepare approved proposals for implementation workflow
**No Git Operations**: APPROVE commands never commit, push, or merge

## Application Proposal Approval Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Application proposal approval provides structured acceptance of completed proposals, updating development tracking to prepare for systematic implementation cycles. Approval focuses exclusively on proposal acceptance and development preparation.

**Approval Workflow**: @APPROVE processes WaitingApproval/ proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md priorities ‚Üí ApplicationProtocols/DEVELOP.md implements ‚Üí Progress tracked through development cycle

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **APPROVE**: Accepts proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md ‚Üí NO implementation
- **PLAN**: Creates proposals ‚Üí NO approval decisions
- **DEVELOP**: Implements approved proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md progress ‚Üí NO approval
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md completion ‚Üí NO approval
- **TRACKING**: Central progress store ‚Üí Updated by APPROVE and other commands ‚Üí NO command execution

**Quality Standards**: Application proposal approval includes proposal validation, priority assignment, and systematic development preparation

**Technical Focus Only**: Approval strictly focuses on technical proposal acceptance and development preparation. No consideration of non-technical aspects (community involvement, adoption, marketing, business strategy, user engagement, etc.)

## Application Proposal Approval Methodology

### Phase 1: Application Proposal Analysis
1. **WaitingApproval/ Directory Scan** ‚Üí Identify available application proposals ready for approval
2. **Proposal Validation** ‚Üí Validate proposal completeness and technical specification quality
3. **Priority Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze proposal priority and application development impact
4. **Implementation Readiness** ‚Üí Assess proposal readiness for application development implementation
5. **Framework Integration Analysis** ‚Üí Understand framework integration requirements and dependencies
6. **User Experience Assessment** ‚Üí Evaluate user experience impact and implementation requirements

### Phase 2: Application Proposal Approval
1. **Proposal Acceptance** ‚Üí Accept application proposals for implementation
2. **Priority Assignment** ‚Üí Assign implementation priorities based on proposal analysis
3. **TRACKING.md Integration** ‚Üí Update application development tracking with approved proposals
4. **Development Planning** ‚Üí Prepare approved proposals for application development cycle execution
5. **Implementation Coordination** ‚Üí Coordinate proposal implementation with application development workflow

### Phase 3: Application Development Preparation
1. **Development Cycle Setup** ‚Üí Prepare application development cycle for approved proposals
2. **Progress Tracking Integration** ‚Üí Integrate approved proposals into application tracking system
3. **Implementation Roadmap** ‚Üí Create implementation roadmap for application development execution
4. **Quality Gate Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare quality validation for proposal implementation
5. **Coordination Updates** ‚Üí Update application development coordination for approved proposals

## Application Proposal Approval Process

### Application Proposals Processing (AxiomExampleApp/Proposals/)
**Source Directory**: WaitingApproval/ ‚Üí Application proposals ready for approval
**Target Integration**: TRACKING.md ‚Üí Application development priority and progress tracking
**Implementation Flow**: Approved proposals ‚Üí ApplicationProtocols/DEVELOP.md execution
**Archive Management**: Completed proposals ‚Üí Archive/ directory for reference

### Application Proposal Lifecycle Management

#### Application Proposal Approval States
- **WaitingApproval**: Application proposals ready for approval review
- **Under Review**: Proposals being analyzed for approval decision
- **Approved**: Proposals accepted and integrated into application development tracking
- **In Development Queue**: Approved proposals prepared for implementation
- **Development Ready**: Proposals ready for ApplicationProtocols/DEVELOP.md execution

#### Application Approval Workflow Integration
1. **ApplicationProtocols/@APPROVE** ‚Üí Processes application proposals from AxiomExampleApp/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
2. **Proposal Validation** ‚Üí Validates proposal quality and implementation readiness
3. **TRACKING.md Updates** ‚Üí Updates ApplicationProtocols/TRACKING.md with approved proposal priorities
4. **Development Preparation** ‚Üí Prepares approved proposals for application development cycle execution
5. **ApplicationProtocols/@DEVELOP** ‚Üí Implements approved proposals using updated tracking priorities
6. **ApplicationProtocols/@CHECKPOINT** ‚Üí Completes implementation and archives completed proposals

## Application Approval Command Execution

**Command**: `@APPROVE [proposal|review|batch]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive application proposal approval workflow with development preparation

### üîÑ **Approval Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: APPROVE commands work on current branch state - NO git operations

```bash
# Navigate to application workspace
echo "üîÑ Entering application development workspace..."
cd application-workspace/ || {
    echo "‚ùå Application workspace not found"
    echo "üí° Run '@WORKSPACE setup' to initialize worktrees"
    exit 1
}

# Approval workflow (NO git operations)
echo "‚úÖ Application Proposal Approval Execution"
echo "üìç Workspace: $(pwd)"
echo "üåø Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "üîó Framework access: AxiomFramework-dev ‚Üí ../framework-workspace/AxiomFramework"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Version control managed by @CHECKPOINT only"
echo "‚úÖ Approval ready - proceeding in application workspace"
```

**Automated Approval Process**:
1. **WaitingApproval/ Analysis** ‚Üí Scan AxiomExampleApp/Proposals/WaitingApproval/ for available proposals
2. **Proposal Validation** ‚Üí Validate proposal completeness and technical specification quality
3. **Priority Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze proposal priorities and implementation dependencies
4. **Approval Processing** ‚Üí Accept proposals for application development implementation
5. **TRACKING.md Updates** ‚Üí Update ApplicationProtocols/TRACKING.md with approved proposal priorities
6. **Development Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare approved proposals for application development cycle execution
7. **Implementation Coordination** ‚Üí Coordinate proposal implementation with application development workflow
**No Git Operations**: All version control handled by @CHECKPOINT commands only


**Application Approval Execution Examples**:
- `@APPROVE` ‚Üí Approve available application proposals and update development tracking
- `@APPROVE proposal` ‚Üí Approve specific application proposal by name
- `@APPROVE review` ‚Üí Review and approve application proposals after validation
- `@APPROVE batch` ‚Üí Approve multiple application proposals in sequence
