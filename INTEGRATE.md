# Axiom Framework Integration Guide

You are Claude Code refining the Axiom framework through real-world testing and integration cycles with AxiomTestApp.

## 🤖 Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@INTEGRATE`
**Action**: Automatically enter ultrathink mode and execute next roadmap task

**Process**:
1. **Read INTEGRATE.md** → Load this complete guide
2. **Check ROADMAP.md** → Identify highest priority 🔄 (active) or ⏳ (queued) INTEGRATE tasks
3. **Execute Test App Workflow** → Use AxiomTestApp for real-world validation and API refinement
4. **Update Progress** → Mark task complete (✅) in ROADMAP.md

## 🎯 INTEGRATE Mode Mission

**Focus**: Create feedback-driven integration testing that improves both framework implementation and demonstrates full capabilities through real-world usage.

**Philosophy**: Integration testing is a discovery process where framework limitations are identified and resolved. The test app serves as both validation tool and framework improvement driver through real-world usage patterns.

**Feedback-Driven Principle**: Integration issues indicate framework implementation gaps. Each integration challenge should drive framework enhancements, ensuring the framework evolves based on actual usage requirements.

**Scaling Principle**: Application complexity must match framework sophistication. As framework capabilities grow, test app must demonstrate those capabilities in real scenarios, with framework changes expected during integration.

## 🧪 AxiomTestApp Integration Workflow

### **Feedback-Driven Integration Environment**
- **Location**: `/AxiomTestApp/ExampleApp/` + `/AxiomFramework/Sources/Axiom/`
- **Purpose**: Test framework APIs in actual iOS application context AND improve framework based on integration findings
- **Integration**: Workspace with live framework dependency resolution enabling immediate framework changes
- **Structure**: Bi-directional development - test app drives framework improvements, framework changes validate in test app
- **Expectation**: Framework code changes are normal and required during integration cycles

## ⚠️ Critical Integration Rules

### **Framework-First Integration Approach** (ESSENTIAL!)
- **Integration issues indicate framework problems** → Fix framework, don't work around in test app
- **Both framework AND test app must build successfully** → Integration not complete until both compile cleanly
- **All framework features must be integrated** → Test app must demonstrate every implemented framework capability
- **Framework changes expected and required** → Integration cycle includes active framework development

### **Naming Consistency** (NEVER BREAK!)
- **RealAxiomApplication** → Keep this name, improve framework implementation underneath
- **RealCounterView** → Keep this name, enhance with new framework APIs
- **RealCounterContext** → Keep this name, add framework convenience features
- **Principle**: Improve framework implementations, maintain test app API consistency

### **Framework Enhancement Approach**
- **Fix framework issues, don't workaround** → Integration problems require framework solutions
- **Enhance framework APIs based on real usage** → Test app usage patterns drive framework API design
- **Test framework changes in Examples/ first** → Validate framework improvements before main component integration
- **Measure framework improvements** with concrete metrics (reduced boilerplate, improved performance, fewer errors)

## 🎯 Current Integration Successes

### **Streamlined APIs Delivered** ✅
- **AxiomApplicationBuilder**: 70% reduction in initialization boilerplate
- **ContextStateBinder**: 80% reduction in manual state synchronization
- **Type-Safe Binding**: Compile-time checked KeyPath relationships
- **Error Prevention**: Automatic patterns eliminate manual sync bugs

### **Proven Patterns**
```swift
// Before: Complex manual setup (25+ lines)
let capabilityManager = await GlobalCapabilityManager.shared.getManager()
// ... 20+ more lines of manual setup

// After: Simple builder pattern (7 lines)
let appBuilder = AxiomApplicationBuilder.counterApp()
await appBuilder.build()
```

### **Real Usage Validation**
- ✅ Framework builds cleanly with test app
- ✅ All streamlined APIs work in real iOS context

```

### **Component Update Workflow**
```bash
# 4. Update relevant component based on learnings
cd Models/        # For state/client changes
cd Contexts/      # For orchestration changes  
cd Views/         # For UI integration changes
cd Utils/         # For app-level changes

# 5. Integration works automatically through imports
# No breaking changes to main app flow
```
