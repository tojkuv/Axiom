# Commands Directory

**Strategic & Cross-Cutting Commands** - General-purpose commands that support both framework and application development.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### **Strategic & Planning Commands**
Cross-cutting commands that span both development tracks:
- **ROADMAP.md** - Strategic planning and roadmap management  
- **WORKSPACE.md** - Cognitive workstation standards and guidelines
- **PLAN.md** - Strategic planning and proposal generation
- **APPROVE.md** - Proposal approval and integration workflow
- **REVISE.md** - Proposal revision and refinement workflow
- **CHECKPOINT.md** - Cross-cutting checkpoint coordination

## üèóÔ∏è Development Command Organization

Development commands are now organized by target audience in top-level directories:

### **FrameworkDevelopment/** - For Axiom Core Developers
Commands for developers working on the Axiom framework itself:
```bash
FrameworkDevelopment/DEVELOP.md      # Framework feature development
FrameworkDevelopment/INTEGRATE.md    # Framework validation and testing
FrameworkDevelopment/REFACTOR.md     # Framework organization
FrameworkDevelopment/CHECKPOINT.md   # Version control coordination
```

### **ApplicationDevelopment/** - For Axiom Framework Users  
Commands for developers building applications with released Axiom versions:
```bash
ApplicationDevelopment/FEATURE.md    # Application feature development
ApplicationDevelopment/DEPLOY.md     # Application deployment and release
ApplicationDevelopment/MAINTAIN.md   # Application maintenance and optimization
ApplicationDevelopment/SHIP.md       # Application shipping and App Store management
```

## ü§ñ Strategic Planning

### **Cross-Track Planning**
```bash
@PLAN d          # Development cycle planning
@PLAN i          # Integration cycle planning  
@PLAN r          # Refactor cycle planning
@PLAN f          # Feature cycle planning
@PLAN (main)     # Strategic cognitive synthesis
```

## üéØ Organization Philosophy

**Clear Separation of Concerns**: Framework developers and application developers have distinct needs, workflows, and quality standards requiring separate command sets.

**Strategic Coordination**: Cross-cutting commands in this directory provide strategic planning and coordination capabilities that benefit both development tracks.

**Agent Optimization**: All commands are designed specifically for autonomous AI agent execution with comprehensive methodology enforcement.
