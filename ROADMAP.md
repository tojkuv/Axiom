- **Success**: Clean structure enabling efficient next development phase

**PLAN.md** → Sprint Coordination
- **Updates**: CURRENT SPRINT STATUS and UPCOMING PRIORITIES based on deliverables
- **Focus**: Assess cycle completions, plan next sprints, maintain roadmap accuracy
- **Triggers**: Cycle completion, strategic priority changes, roadmap updates needed
- **Success**: Clear next sprint definition with realistic scope and success criteria

**PROPOSE.md** → Strategic Rethinking & Improvement
- **Updates**: Provides comprehensive proposals for framework, test app, and process improvements
- **Focus**: Strategic analysis, architectural optimization, process enhancement, innovation acceleration
- **Triggers**: Major milestone completion, strategic review needs, innovation opportunity identification
- **Success**: Actionable improvement proposals with clear benefits and implementation plans

### **Automated Update Workflow**

1. **Cycle Completion** → Cycle mode updates their DELIVERABLES section
2. **Sprint Assessment** → PLAN.md reads all deliverables and current priorities  
3. **Next Sprint Planning** → PLAN.md selects next cycle and defines new sprint
4. **Roadmap Updates** → PLAN.md updates CURRENT SPRINT STATUS and priorities
5. **Coordination** → Next cycle mode reads updated roadmap and executes

- Code structure optimized for maintainability  
- Completed work archived properly
- Development environment enhanced

**PLAN.md Updates When**:
- Any cycle completes and reports deliverables
- Strategic priorities need adjustment
- Sprint scope needs refinement
- Cross-cycle coordination required
