## üèóÔ∏è Framework Development Philosophy

**Core Infrastructure Focus**: These commands are designed for building the foundational infrastructure that application developers will use. Every change affects all downstream users.

**Quality Standards**: Framework development requires the highest quality standards with comprehensive testing, architectural integrity, and performance optimization.

**Advanced Capabilities**: Focus on building innovative AI-agent capabilities that advance iOS development.

## üß† AI Agent Integration

All framework development commands are optimized for autonomous AI agent execution with:
- Comprehensive methodology enforcement
- Intelligent execution loops
- Automated quality validation
- Machine-readable feedback and results

## üö´ Usage Restrictions

**Framework Developers Only**: These commands are exclusively for developers working on the Axiom framework core. Application developers using Axiom should use the commands in `ApplicationDevelopment/`.

**Production Impact**: All framework changes affect every application using Axiom. Use with appropriate caution and comprehensive testing.
