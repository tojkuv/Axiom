# @PLAN.md - Axiom Framework Development Planning Command

Framework development planning command that creates proposals for framework implementation

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@PLAN [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute framework development planning workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@PLAN`** ‚Üí Create framework development proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Active/
- **`@PLAN plan`** ‚Üí Plan framework development tasks and create proposal
- **`@PLAN analyze`** ‚Üí Analyze framework needs and create implementation proposal
- **`@PLAN enhance`** ‚Üí Plan framework enhancements and capability improvements

### Framework Planning Scope
**Planning Focus**: Framework development proposal creation and strategic planning
**Branch Requirement**: Must be executed from framework branch for framework development
**Proposal Creation**: Creates structured framework proposals for user review and revision
**Development Integration**: Proposals are implemented through FrameworkDevelopment/DEVELOP.md after user approval

### üîÑ **Standardized Git Workflow**
All FrameworkDevelopment commands follow this workflow:
1. **Branch Setup**: Switch to `framework` branch (create if doesn't exist)
2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `framework` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `framework` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `framework` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `framework` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Framework Development Planning Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Framework planning creates detailed proposals for framework development that can be reviewed, revised, and approved by users before implementation begins.

**Proposal Workflow**: @PLAN creates framework proposals ‚Üí User reviews/revises ‚Üí FrameworkDevelopment/DEVELOP.md implements ‚Üí Progress tracked in FrameworkDevelopment/TRACKING.md

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **PLAN**: Reads TRACKING.md priorities ‚Üí Creates proposals ‚Üí NO implementation
- **DEVELOP**: Implements proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md progress ‚Üí NO planning
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md completion ‚Üí NO development
- **REFACTOR**: Code organization ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md quality ‚Üí NO functionality changes
- **TRACKING**: Central progress store ‚Üí Updated by all commands ‚Üí NO command execution

**Quality Standards**: Framework proposals include comprehensive technical specifications, implementation approaches, and success criteria

## Framework Planning Methodology

### Phase 1: Framework Analysis
1. **TRACKING.md Review** ‚Üí Read current priorities, progress, and next actions from FrameworkDevelopment/TRACKING.md
2. **Current Framework Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze current framework implementation status and needs
3. **Requirements Analysis** ‚Üí Understand framework development objectives and constraints
4. **Technical Assessment** ‚Üí Evaluate framework technical approaches and implementation strategies
5. **Architecture Planning** ‚Üí Assess framework architecture changes and resource requirements
6. **Success Criteria Definition** ‚Üí Define measurable framework outcomes and validation criteria

### Phase 2: Framework Proposal Creation
1. **Technical Specification** ‚Üí Create detailed framework technical approach and architecture
2. **Implementation Planning** ‚Üí Plan framework development phases and implementation steps
3. **Testing Strategy** ‚Üí Define framework testing approach and validation procedures
4. **Documentation Planning** ‚Üí Plan framework documentation updates and requirements
5. **Integration Strategy** ‚Üí Define integration with existing framework codebase and workflows

### Phase 3: Framework Proposal Documentation
1. **Structured Format** ‚Üí Create framework proposal using established format and sections
2. **Technical Details** ‚Üí Include comprehensive framework technical specifications and approaches
3. **Implementation Roadmap** ‚Üí Provide clear framework implementation steps and phases
4. **Success Metrics** ‚Üí Define measurable framework success criteria and validation approaches
5. **Review Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare framework proposal for user review and potential revision

## Framework Proposal Creation Process

### Framework Proposals (AxiomFramework/Proposals/)
**Focus**: Core framework development, architecture enhancements, capability implementation
**Directories**: 
- Active/: Framework proposals under development
- WaitingApproval/: Framework proposals ready for user review
- Archive/: Completed framework proposals
**Implementation**: Implemented through FrameworkDevelopment/DEVELOP.md
**Progress Tracking**: Tracked in FrameworkDevelopment/TRACKING.md

## Framework Proposal Lifecycle Management

### Framework Proposal States
- **Active**: Framework proposal created in Active/ directory, under development
- **Waiting Approval**: Framework proposal moved to WaitingApproval/ directory, ready for user review
- **Under Revision**: User requests changes, framework proposal updated in Active/ directory
- **Approved**: User approves framework proposal, ready for FrameworkDevelopment/DEVELOP.md implementation
- **In Development**: FrameworkDevelopment/DEVELOP.md implementing proposal, progress tracked in TRACKING.md
- **Completed**: Framework implementation complete, proposal archived to Archive/ directory

### Framework Workflow Integration
1. **FrameworkDevelopment/@PLAN** ‚Üí Creates framework proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Active/
2. **Proposal Completion** ‚Üí Framework proposal moved to AxiomFramework/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
3. **User Review** ‚Üí User reviews and optionally revises framework proposal
4. **User Approval** ‚Üí User approves framework proposal for implementation
5. **FrameworkDevelopment/@DEVELOP** ‚Üí Implements framework proposal, tracks progress in TRACKING.md
6. **FrameworkDevelopment/@CHECKPOINT** ‚Üí Completes framework implementation, archives proposal

## Framework Planning Command Execution

**Command**: `@PLAN [plan|analyze|enhance]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive framework planning workflow with proposal creation

### üîÑ **Branch Verification and Setup**

**Before executing any planning work, execute this branch verification:**

```bash
# 1. Check current branch and switch to framework branch if needed
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "üéØ Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "framework" ]; then
    echo "üîÑ Switching from $CURRENT_BRANCH to framework branch..."
    
    # Check if framework branch exists
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/framework; then
        echo "üìç Framework branch exists locally, switching..."
        git checkout framework
    elif git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/framework; then
        echo "üìç Framework branch exists remotely, checking out..."
        git checkout -b framework origin/framework
    else
        echo "üå± Creating new framework branch..."
        git checkout -b framework
        git push origin framework -u
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Now on framework branch"
else
    echo "‚úÖ Already on framework branch"
fi

# 2. Update framework branch with latest changes
echo "üîÑ Updating framework branch..."
git fetch origin framework 2>/dev/null || true
git pull origin framework 2>/dev/null || echo "üìç No remote updates available"

echo "üéØ Branch verification complete - ready for framework planning"
```

**Automated Execution Process**:
1. **Branch Verification** ‚Üí Switch to `framework` branch and update with latest changes
2. **TRACKING.md Priority Analysis** ‚Üí Read current priorities and status from FrameworkDevelopment/TRACKING.md
3. **Framework Context Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze existing framework implementation and identify development needs
4. **Requirements Assessment** ‚Üí Understand framework development objectives and constraints
5. **Technical Planning** ‚Üí Design framework technical approach and implementation strategy
6. **Framework Proposal Creation** ‚Üí Create structured framework proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Active/
7. **Review Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare framework proposal for user review and potential revision

**Framework Planning Execution Examples**:
- `@PLAN` ‚Üí Create framework development proposal
- `@PLAN plan` ‚Üí Plan framework development tasks and create proposal
- `@PLAN analyze` ‚Üí Analyze framework needs and create implementation proposal
- `@PLAN enhance` ‚Üí Plan framework enhancements and capability improvements
