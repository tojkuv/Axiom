# Axiom Framework Development Tracking

Proposal progress tracking for framework core implementation and infrastructure

## Framework Development Focus

**Purpose**: Track current proposal progress across development sessions
**Scope**: Framework architecture, capabilities, performance, testing infrastructure
**Objective**: Monitor proposal implementation progress and development findings

### ðŸ”„ **Standardized Git Workflow**
All FrameworkDevelopment commands follow this workflow:
1. **Branch Setup**: Switch to `framework` branch (create if doesn't exist)
2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `framework` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `framework` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `framework` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `framework` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Current Framework Status

### Core Infrastructure Implementation
- **Architectural Constraints**: 8 architectural constraints implemented
- **Actor System**: Thread-safe state management with AxiomClient
- **Context Orchestration**: Client coordination and SwiftUI integration  
- **Intelligence System**: Architecture analysis and optimization capabilities
- **Capability System**: Runtime validation with compile-time optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated metrics collection and analysis

### Framework Capabilities Implementation

## ðŸ”„ **Development Workflow**

### **Command Execution Cycle**
```bash
# Standard Development Cycle (5 Steps)
1. FrameworkDevelopment/PLAN.md      # Read TRACKING.md priorities â†’ Create proposals
2. FrameworkDevelopment/DEVELOP.md   # Implement proposals â†’ Update TRACKING.md progress
3. FrameworkDevelopment/CHECKPOINT.md # Merge to main â†’ Update TRACKING.md completion
4. FrameworkDevelopment/REFACTOR.md  # Structural improvements â†’ Update TRACKING.md quality
5. FrameworkDevelopment/CHECKPOINT.md # Final merge â†’ Fresh cycle â†’ Update TRACKING.md
```

### **Command Separation of Concerns**
- **PLAN**: Reads TRACKING.md current priorities â†’ Creates structured development proposals
- **DEVELOP**: Implements proposals â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with implementation progress
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow management â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with merge completion
- **REFACTOR**: Code organization improvements â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with quality metrics
- **TRACKING**: Central progress coordination â†’ Updated by all commands

### **TRACKING.md Integration**
All commands integrate with TRACKING.md:
- **Read Operations**: PLAN.md reads current priorities and focuses development
- **Write Operations**: DEVELOP.md, CHECKPOINT.md, REFACTOR.md update progress and completion
- **Coordination**: TRACKING.md maintains current state across all development sessions

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on memory and actor performance
2. **Developer Experience**: Improve macro diagnostics and error messages
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Complete test framework implementation
4. **Documentation**: Finalize API documentation and examples

### Planning Integration
- **Development Planning**: Use `@PLAN d` for development cycle planning
- **Progress Tracking**: Regular checkpoint coordination
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous testing and validation
- **User Feedback**: Framework user feedback integration
