## 🎯 Mission

**Axiom** transforms iOS development through architectural intelligence with one core principle:  
**Humans make decisions, AI writes and maintains all code.**

## 🧠 Revolutionary Intelligence Features

### 8 Breakthrough Intelligence Systems
1. **Architectural DNA** - Complete component introspection and self-documentation
2. **Intent-Driven Evolution** - Predictive architecture evolution based on business intent
3. **Natural Language Queries** - Explore architecture in plain English
4. **Self-Optimizing Performance** - Continuous learning and automatic optimization
5. **Constraint Propagation** - Automatic business rule compliance (GDPR, PCI, etc.)
6. **Emergent Pattern Detection** - Learning and codifying new patterns
7. **Temporal Development Workflows** - Sophisticated experiment management
8. **Predictive Architecture Intelligence** - **THE BREAKTHROUGH** - Problem prevention before occurrence

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### The 8 Fundamental Constraints
1. **View-Context Relationship** (1:1 bidirectional binding)
2. **Context-Client Orchestration** (read-only state + cross-cutting concerns)
3. **Client Isolation** (single ownership with actor safety)
4. **Hybrid Capability System** (compile-time hints + 1-3% runtime validation)
5. **Domain Model Architecture** (1:1 client ownership with value objects)
6. **Cross-Domain Coordination** (context orchestration only)
7. **Unidirectional Flow** (Views → Contexts → Clients → Capabilities → System)
8. **Revolutionary Intelligence System** (8 breakthrough AI capabilities)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Option 1: 📱 Run the Actual iOS App** (Recommended!)
```bash
# Open the workspace for integrated development
open Axiom.xcworkspace

# Select AxiomTestApp scheme and run in simulator
# See real framework integration with live demonstrations!
```
👆 **This gives you a real iOS app demonstrating all Axiom features!**

### **Option 2: Framework Development**
```bash
# Build framework independently
cd AxiomFramework && swift build

# Run framework tests
cd AxiomFramework && swift test

# Edit framework code in AxiomFramework/Sources/Axiom/
# Changes automatically available in test app!
```

### **Option 3: Integration Example**
```swift
import Axiom

// Create an actor-based client
actor MyClient: AxiomClient {
    typealias State = MyState
    private(set) var stateSnapshot = MyState()
    let capabilities: CapabilityManager
}

// Create a reactive context
@MainActor
class MyContext: AxiomContext {
    let myClient: MyClient
    let intelligence: AxiomIntelligence
}

// Create a 1:1 SwiftUI view
struct MyView: AxiomView {
    @ObservedObject var context: MyContext
}
```
