# Axiom Framework

The world's first **Intelligent, Predictive Architectural Framework** for iOS development, designed for perfect human-AI collaboration.

## üöÄ Status: Ready for Implementation

Complete architecture and specifications finalized. Development documentation streamlined for efficient implementation.

## üéØ Mission

**Axiom** transforms iOS development through architectural intelligence with one core principle:  
**Humans make decisions, AI writes and maintains all code.**

## üß† Revolutionary Intelligence Features

### 8 Breakthrough Intelligence Systems
1. **Architectural DNA** - Complete component introspection and self-documentation
2. **Intent-Driven Evolution** - Predictive architecture evolution based on business intent
3. **Natural Language Queries** - Explore architecture in plain English
4. **Self-Optimizing Performance** - Continuous learning and automatic optimization
5. **Constraint Propagation** - Automatic business rule compliance (GDPR, PCI, etc.)
6. **Emergent Pattern Detection** - Learning and codifying new patterns
7. **Temporal Development Workflows** - Sophisticated experiment management
8. **Predictive Architecture Intelligence** - **THE BREAKTHROUGH** - Problem prevention before occurrence

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### The 8 Fundamental Constraints
1. **View-Context Relationship** (1:1 bidirectional binding)
2. **Context-Client Orchestration** (read-only state + cross-cutting concerns)
3. **Client Isolation** (single ownership with actor safety)
4. **Hybrid Capability System** (compile-time hints + 1-3% runtime validation)
5. **Domain Model Architecture** (1:1 client ownership with value objects)
6. **Cross-Domain Coordination** (context orchestration only)
7. **Unidirectional Flow** (Views ‚Üí Contexts ‚Üí Clients ‚Üí Capabilities ‚Üí System)
8. **Revolutionary Intelligence System** (8 breakthrough AI capabilities)

## ‚ö° Performance Targets

### Foundation Performance (Tier 1)
- **50x faster** state access vs TCA
- **30% memory reduction** vs baseline
- **<3% runtime cost** capability system
- **60% faster** startup time

### Revolutionary Benefits (Tier 3)
- **10x development velocity** through predictive intelligence
- **90% problem prevention** through architectural foresight
- **Zero surprise development** - no unexpected architectural problems
- **120x faster** state access with full optimization

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open Axiom.xcworkspace

# Or use the setup script
./setup_xcode_project.sh
```

## üì¶ What's Included

- **Axiom Framework** - The core intelligent framework
- **Example Applications** - See `Examples/` directory
- **Complete Test Suite** - Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- **Swift Macros** - Boilerplate elimination with @Client, @Capabilities, etc.

## üîÑ Development Status

### Current Phase: Implementation Ready
