# Axiom Framework

An architectural framework for iOS development that integrates actor-based state management with intelligent system analysis capabilities.

## Current Status

Framework implementation with modular workspace structure and test application validation.

### Build Status
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd Axiom
swift build  # Framework builds successfully
open Axiom.xcworkspace  # Integrated workspace with test application
```

### Framework Features
- **Intelligence Queries**: System analysis through natural language interface
- **Actor State Management**: Thread-safe state management with SwiftUI integration  
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Reactive binding with defined component relationships
- **Runtime Capabilities**: Dynamic capability validation system
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated metrics collection and analysis
- **Streamlined APIs**: Reduced boilerplate through builder patterns

## Design Philosophy

Axiom facilitates iOS development through architectural analysis capabilities designed for human-AI collaborative workflows.

## Intelligence System Components

### System Analysis Features
1. **Component Introspection** - Architectural analysis and documentation generation
2. **Intent-Based Evolution** - Architecture adaptation based on specified requirements
3. **Natural Language Queries** - Architecture exploration through text interface
4. **Performance Analysis** - Automated performance monitoring and optimization suggestions
5. **Constraint Validation** - Business rule compliance checking
6. **Pattern Recognition** - Code pattern identification and standardization
7. **Development Workflow Management** - Experiment and feature branch coordination
8. **Predictive Analysis** - Issue identification and prevention recommendations

## Core Architecture

### Architectural Constraints
1. **View-Context Relationship** (1:1 bidirectional binding)
2. **Context-Client Orchestration** (read-only state + cross-cutting concerns)
3. **Client Isolation** (single ownership with actor safety)
4. **Hybrid Capability System** (compile-time hints + runtime validation)
5. **Domain Model Architecture** (1:1 client ownership with value objects)
6. **Cross-Domain Coordination** (context orchestration only)
7. **Unidirectional Flow** (Views → Contexts → Clients → Capabilities → System)
8. **Intelligence System Integration** (analysis and monitoring capabilities)

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Run iOS Test Application
```bash
# Open the workspace for development
open Axiom.xcworkspace

# Select AxiomExampleApp scheme and run in simulator
# Example application demonstrates framework integration
```

### Option 2: Framework Development
```bash
# Build framework independently
cd AxiomFramework && swift build

# Run framework tests
cd AxiomFramework && swift test

# Edit framework code in AxiomFramework/Sources/Axiom/
# Changes available in test app through workspace dependency
```

### Option 3: Basic Integration
```swift
import Axiom

// Create an actor-based client
actor MyClient: AxiomClient {
    typealias State = MyState
    private(set) var stateSnapshot = MyState()
    let capabilities: CapabilityManager
}

// Create a reactive context
@MainActor
class MyContext: AxiomContext {
    let myClient: MyClient
    let intelligence: AxiomIntelligence
}

// Create a 1:1 SwiftUI view
struct MyView: AxiomView {
    @ObservedObject var context: MyContext
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Design Goals
- Optimized state access through actor-based architecture
- Memory efficiency through value type usage
- Minimal runtime overhead for capability system
- Reduced startup overhead through lazy initialization

### Development Benefits
- Improved development velocity through code generation
- Reduced debugging through compile-time validation
- Architectural consistency through constraint enforcement
- Performance monitoring integration

## Test Application

### AxiomExampleApp Implementation
The included iOS application demonstrates:
- **AxiomClient Integration**: Actor-based state management with observer pattern
- **Intelligence System**: Natural language architectural query interface  
- **Context Orchestration**: SwiftUI reactive integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated analytics and metrics collection
- **Capability Validation**: Runtime checking with graceful degradation
- **API Usage**: AxiomApplicationBuilder and ContextStateBinder patterns

### Development Experience Improvements
| Area | Traditional Approach | Framework Approach | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Application Setup | Manual boilerplate | Builder pattern | Reduced configuration code |
| State Synchronization | Manual updates | Automatic binding | Observer pattern integration |
| Property Binding | Manual MainActor handling | Type-safe binding | Compile-time validation |
| Error Handling | Manual type checks | Framework validation | Integrated error prevention |
