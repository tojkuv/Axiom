# Axiom Framework

The world's first intelligent, self-evolving iOS development framework designed for perfect human-AI collaboration.

## üéØ Mission

**Axiom** redefines the relationship between human developers and AI coding agents with one core principle:  
**Humans make decisions, AI writes and maintains all code.**

## üèóÔ∏è Revolutionary Architecture

Built on principles from:
- **WASM** (capability-based security)
- **Rust** (ownership model) 
- **Git** (versioning and recovery)
- **Modern iOS patterns** (SwiftUI integration)
- **AI Intelligence** (architectural DNA, predictive capabilities, self-optimization)

### Core Constraints + Intelligence
- **Views** can only depend on their respective **Context** (1:1 relationship)
- **Contexts** orchestrate **Clients** with read-only state access + domain coordination
- **Clients** are completely isolated with single state ownership + domain models
- **Capabilities** provide hybrid system access with intelligent validation
- **Intelligence System** provides architectural DNA, predictive optimization, and self-evolution

### Revolutionary Intelligence Features
- **Architectural DNA**: Complete component introspection and self-documentation
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Prevents problems before they occur
- **Natural Language Queries**: Explore architecture in plain English
- **Self-Optimization**: Continuous performance learning and improvement
- **Intent-Driven Evolution**: Proactive architecture evolution based on business goals
- **Pattern Discovery**: Learns and codifies emerging architectural patterns

## üìä Performance Targets

- **120x faster** state access vs TCA (optimized hybrid approach)
- **1-3% runtime cost** capability system for massive development gains
- **50% memory reduction** through intelligent optimization
- **60% faster** startup time
- **10x development velocity** through predictive intelligence
- **90% problem prevention** through architectural foresight

## üîÑ Development Status

**Current Phase**: Revolutionary intelligent architecture complete  
**Status**: World's first intelligent, self-evolving framework architecture finalized  
**Implementation**: Ready for continued planning or future development

## üöÄ Getting Started

The framework represents the **world's first intelligent, self-evolving architectural framework** with revolutionary capabilities never before achieved.

### Revolutionary Capabilities
- **Architectural Foresight**: Predict and prevent problems before they occur
- **Self-Documentation**: Architecture explains itself in natural language
- **Continuous Optimization**: System improves performance automatically
- **Business Intelligence**: Understands and supports business goals
- **Pattern Evolution**: Learns and teaches new architectural approaches

### Framework Status
The complete intelligent architecture has been finalized with:
- **8 Core Architectural Constraints** (enhanced with intelligence)
- **8 Revolutionary Intelligence Features** (unprecedented capabilities)
- **Domain Model Integration** (comprehensive business logic organization)
- **Predictive Architecture Intelligence** (architectural foresight)

### For Future Implementation
When implementation begins, the framework will deliver:
- **Foundation**: Intelligent core protocols with DNA system
- **Intelligence**: Predictive capabilities and self-optimization
- **Domain Models**: Comprehensive business logic organization
- **Advanced Features**: Complete intelligent architectural framework

## ü§ù Human-AI Collaboration

The framework is designed and implemented entirely by AI agents under human direction:
- **Human Role**: Strategic decisions, requirements, feature specifications
- **AI Role**: Architecture, implementation, testing, optimization, maintenance
