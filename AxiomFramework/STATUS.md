## üéØ Current Focus: Example App Issues & Framework Refinement

### Known Issues in Task Manager Example
1. **SwiftUI Integration**: Potential binding lifecycle issues
2. **State Management**: Edge cases in concurrent updates
3. **Error Propagation**: Some errors not surfacing to UI properly
4. **Performance**: Actual metrics need validation under load

### Framework Improvements Needed
- **API Ergonomics**: Simplify common patterns discovered in example app
- **Error Messages**: More actionable guidance for developers
- **Integration Helpers**: Utilities for common iOS patterns
- **Documentation**: Real-world examples from discovered patterns

## üìã Immediate Priorities

### 1. Debug & Fix Example App (Priority: HIGH)
- Identify root causes of current issues
- Fix framework bugs discovered through usage
- Validate all integration points

### 2. API Refinement (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Simplify verbose patterns found in example
- Add convenience methods for common operations
- Improve type inference where possible

### 3. Developer Experience (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Better error messages with fix suggestions
- Debug helpers and diagnostic tools
- Common pattern templates

### 4. Performance Validation (Priority: LOW)
- Measure actual performance in example app
- Optimize hot paths discovered through profiling
- Validate against initial targets

## üöÄ Path to First Release

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Current)
- Fix all breaking issues in example app
- Refine APIs based on usage patterns
- Ensure smooth developer experience

### Phase 2: Polish
- Additional example apps for validation
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive integration tests

### Phase 3: Release Preparation
- Public API freeze
- Documentation with real examples
- Migration guides and best practices

## üí° Development Philosophy

**"Every error is a teacher"** - Issues discovered in example apps are invaluable for creating a framework that works in the real world. We're not just building theoretical perfection; we're building practical solutions.

### Current Approach
1. **Build real apps** to discover framework limitations
2. **Fix issues pragmatically** - working code over perfect abstractions
3. **Iterate rapidly** - small changes with immediate validation
4. **Document learnings** - capture patterns and anti-patterns
5. **Evolve APIs** based on actual developer needs
