# Axiom Framework: Refinement Phase Guide

## 🎯 Current Mission: Real-World Validation & Framework Polish

**Phase**: Post-Foundation Refinement  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Framework Operational  
**Focus**: Example app issues driving framework improvements  

## 🔄 Refinement Philosophy

> "Every error is a teacher" - Issues discovered in example apps are invaluable for creating a framework that works in the real world.

### Core Principles
1. **Real apps first** - Build actual applications to discover limitations
2. **Fix pragmatically** - Working code over perfect abstractions  
3. **Iterate rapidly** - Small changes with immediate validation
4. **Document learnings** - Capture patterns and anti-patterns
5. **Evolve APIs** - Based on actual developer needs, not theory

## 🚨 Current Critical Issues

### Example App Problems (Priority: HIGH)
Based on STATUS.md, the task manager example has uncovered several issues:

1. **SwiftUI Integration Issues**
   - Potential binding lifecycle problems
   - Views not properly observing context changes
   - Memory leaks in view-context relationships

2. **State Management Edge Cases**
   - Concurrent update conflicts
   - State transaction rollback failures
   - Performance degradation under load

3. **Error Propagation Problems**
   - Errors not surfacing to UI properly
   - Recovery actions not triggering correctly
   - User feedback insufficient for debugging

4. **Performance Validation**
   - Actual metrics don't match theoretical targets
   - Hot paths need optimization
   - Memory usage higher than expected

## 🛠️ Debugging Methodology

### 1. Issue Investigation Process
```
1. Reproduce issue in example app
2. Isolate minimal failing case
3. Identify framework component involved
4. Trace through framework code
5. Determine root cause
6. Design targeted fix
7. Validate fix doesn't break other components
8. Update tests to prevent regression
```

### 2. Common Investigation Tools
- **Performance Profiler**: Identify hot paths and memory issues
- **SwiftUI Debugger**: Trace view update cycles
- **Actor Isolation Analysis**: Find concurrency problems
- **State Transition Logging**: Track state management issues

### 3. Framework Component Priority
1. **AxiomContext** - Most likely source of SwiftUI issues
2. **StateSnapshot/Transaction** - State management problems
3. **AxiomView Integration** - Binding lifecycle issues
4. **Error Handling** - Error propagation failures

## 🎨 API Ergonomics Improvements

### Patterns Found in Example Development

#### Verbose Patterns to Simplify
1. **Client Registration**
   ```swift
   // Current (verbose)
   context.registerClient(UserClient.self, with: UserDomain())
   
   // Target (simplified)
   context.register(UserClient.self)
   ```

2. **Capability Validation**
   ```swift
   // Current (verbose)
   guard capabilities.validate(.networking).isAvailable else { return }
   
   // Target (simplified)
   guard capabilities.has(.networking) else { return }
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```swift
   // Current (verbose)
   .catch { error in
       if case AxiomError.capability(let capError) = error {
           // handle
       }
   }
   
   // Target (simplified)
   .catchCapabilityError { capError in
       // handle
   }
   ```

### API Improvement Strategy
1. **Add convenience methods** for common operations
2. **Improve type inference** where Swift allows
3. **Create builder patterns** for complex configurations
4. **Add result builders** for declarative API usage

## 🏗️ Framework Architecture Discoveries

### Real-World Usage Learnings

#### What Works Well
- Actor-based concurrency model is solid
- Core protocol separation is clean
- Intelligence system integration is smooth
- Macro system reduces boilerplate effectively

#### What Needs Improvement
- SwiftUI integration has edge cases
- Error recovery needs better UX
- Performance monitoring overhead
- Complex debugging when issues occur

#### New Requirements Discovered
- Need debug helpers for developers
- Common iOS pattern integrations missing
- Better guidance for migration from existing patterns
- More comprehensive error messages

## 💡 Agent Development Workflow

### Daily Priorities
1. **Check STATUS.md** for current issues and discoveries
2. **Focus on example apps** - they reveal real problems
3. **Fix one issue at a time** - avoid complex simultaneous changes
4. **Test immediately** - validate fixes don't break other components
5. **Document learnings** - update STATUS.md with progress

### Decision Framework
- **Pragmatic over perfect** - ship working solutions quickly
- **Usage-driven design** - let real usage drive API decisions
- **Incremental improvement** - small focused changes
- **Validate everything** - test every change thoroughly
