# ``Axiom``

An architectural framework for iOS development that integrates actor-based state management with component analysis capabilities.

## Overview

Axiom is a comprehensive architectural framework for iOS development that enforces 8 architectural constraints through actor-based state management and SwiftUI integration. The framework provides component analysis capabilities, runtime capability validation, and performance monitoring to enhance developer productivity while maintaining architectural integrity.

### Key Features

- **Actor-based State Management**: Thread-safe state management using Swift's actor model
- **8 Architectural Constraints**: Enforced patterns for consistent application architecture  
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Seamless reactive binding with defined component relationships
- **Component Analysis Capabilities**: Architectural component discovery and relationship mapping
- **Runtime Capability Validation**: Dynamic validation with graceful degradation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated metrics collection and analysis
- **Macro System**: Code generation for reduced boilerplate (@Client, @Context, @View)

### Architecture Benefits

The framework facilitates iOS development through:
- Reduced debugging through compile-time validation
- Improved development velocity through code generation  
- Architectural consistency through constraint enforcement
- Performance monitoring integration
- Memory efficiency through value type usage
