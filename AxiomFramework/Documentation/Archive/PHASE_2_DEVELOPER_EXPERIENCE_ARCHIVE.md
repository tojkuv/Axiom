## 🏗️ Key Technical Achievements

### **@AxiomClient Macro System**
```swift
// Before Phase 2 (25 lines typical setup)
actor MyClient: AxiomClient {
    typealias State = MyState
    private(set) var stateSnapshot = MyState()
    let capabilities: CapabilityManager
    // ... manual initialization, setup, etc.
}

// After Phase 2 (6 lines with macro)
@AxiomClient
actor MyClient {
    struct State { /* ... */ }
    // Automatic setup, validation, performance monitoring
}
```

### **AxiomDiagnostics System**
- **8 Diagnostic Checks**: Client registration, capability validation, performance monitoring, state consistency, dependency resolution, error handling, integration health, optimization suggestions
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific guidance for improving framework usage and performance
- **Real-Time Health Monitoring**: Continuous assessment during development and runtime

### **Type-Safe Client Access Patterns**
- **ClientContainerHelpers**: Factory methods and utilities for safe client discovery
- **Compile-Time Validation**: Prevents runtime errors through strong typing
- **Builder Patterns**: Streamlined client configuration and dependency injection
