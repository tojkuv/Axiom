# Axiom Framework: Complete Overview

## üéØ What is Axiom?

**Axiom** is the world's first **Intelligent, Predictive Architectural Framework** for iOS development, designed specifically for perfect human-AI collaboration. It represents a fundamental paradigm shift from reactive to predictive development.

### Core Mission
**Humans make decisions, AI writes and maintains all code.**

## üèóÔ∏è Revolutionary Architecture

### The 8 Fundamental Constraints

#### 1. View-Context Relationship (1:1 Bidirectional)
```swift
struct UserProfileView: AxiomView {
    typealias Context = UserProfileContext // Perfect 1:1 binding
}
```

#### 2. Context-Client Orchestration (Read-Only + Cross-Cutting)
```swift
struct UserProfileContext: AxiomContext {
    @Client var userClient: UserClient          // Orchestrates clients
    @CrossCutting(.analytics, .logging)         // Supervised cross-cutting
    var services: CrossCuttingServices
}
```

#### 3. Client Isolation (Single Ownership)
```swift
actor UserClient: AxiomClient {
    private var _state = State()               // Owns state exclusively
    var stateSnapshot: State { _state }        // Read-only access
}
```

#### 4. Hybrid Capability System (Compile-Time + Runtime)
```swift
@Capabilities([.network, .keychain])          // Compile-time hints
actor NetworkClient: AxiomClient {
    func makeRequest() async throws {
        try capabilities.validate(.network)    // 1-3% runtime cost
    }
}
```

#### 5. Domain Model Architecture (1:1 Client Ownership)
```swift
struct User: DomainModel {                    // Value object
    let id: User.ID
    let name: String
    func validate() -> ValidationResult { /* business logic */ }
}

actor UserClient: AxiomClient {               // Owns User domain exclusively
    struct State { var users: [User.ID: User] }
}
```

#### 6. Cross-Domain Coordination (Context Orchestration Only)
```swift
struct CheckoutContext: AxiomContext {
    func processCheckout() async throws {
        let user = userClient.stateSnapshot.currentUser    // Read snapshot
        let order = try await orderClient.createOrder(userId: user.id) // ID reference
    }
}
```

#### 7. Unidirectional Dependency Flow
```
Views ‚Üí Contexts ‚Üí [Domain Clients + Domain Models] ‚Üí Capabilities ‚Üí System
```

#### 8. Revolutionary Intelligence System
Complete architectural intelligence with 8 breakthrough capabilities (detailed below).

## üß† Revolutionary Intelligence Features

}
```

// "Generate complexity report for user domain"
```

**Capabilities**:
- Human-accessible architecture exploration
- Stakeholder communication bridge
- Complexity assessment through natural language
- Business impact explanations

### 4. Self-Optimizing Performance Intelligence
Continuous learning and automatic optimization:
```swift
protocol PerformanceIntelligent {
    var performanceProfile: PerformanceProfile { get }
    var optimizationOpportunities: [OptimizationOpportunity] { get }
    var learningHistory: LearningHistory { get }
}
```

**Capabilities**:
- Runtime behavior analysis and learning

### 5. Constraint Propagation Engine
Automatic business rule compliance:
```swift
protocol ConstraintPropagating {
    var businessConstraints: [BusinessConstraint] { get }
    var propagatedConstraints: [PropagatedConstraint] { get }
    var complianceStatus: ComplianceStatus { get }
}
```

**Capabilities**:
- Business constraints flow through entire architecture
- Compliance code generation (GDPR, PCI, etc.)
- Business rule consistency enforcement
- Automatic regulatory compliance validation

### 6. Emergent Pattern Detection
Learning and codifying new architectural patterns:
```swift
protocol PatternLearning {
    var detectedPatterns: [EmergentPattern] { get }
    var reusageOpportunities: [ReusageOpportunity] { get }
}
```

**Capabilities**:
- Continuous code pattern analysis
- Automatic pattern abstraction and codification
- Evolving pattern library with community sharing
- Optimal pattern recommendations

### 7. Temporal Development Workflows
Sophisticated experiment and timeline management:
```swift
protocol TemporallyAware {
    var developmentTimeline: DevelopmentTimeline { get }
    var parallelExperiments: [ExperimentBranch] { get }
    var futureMilestones: [DevelopmentMilestone] { get }
}
```

**Capabilities**:

    var riskAssessment: RiskAssessment { get }
    var preventiveActions: [PreventiveAction] { get }
}
```

**Capabilities**:

## üè¢ Domain Architecture

### Client Types
```swift
// Domain Clients (Own exactly one domain model)
actor UserClient: AxiomClient {
    struct State { var users: [User.ID: User] }  // Owns User domain
}

// Infrastructure Clients (No domain models)
actor NetworkClient: AxiomClient {
    struct State { var connectionStatus: ConnectionStatus }  // Infrastructure only
}
```

### Cross-Domain Patterns
```swift
struct Order: DomainModel {
    let id: Order.ID
    let userId: User.ID        // ID-based reference only, not User object
}

// Context coordinates cross-domain operations
struct CheckoutContext: AxiomContext {
    func processOrder() async throws {
        let user = userClient.getUser(id: userId)     // Lookup by ID
        let order = await orderClient.create(userId: userId) // Pass ID
    }
}
```
