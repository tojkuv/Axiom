**Mitigation**: 
- Tier-based implementation with fallbacks
- Continuous validation and benchmarking
- Alternative implementation strategies for each feature

#### **Adoption Risks (High)**
**Risk**: Developers may find framework too complex or different
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive documentation and tutorials
- Migration tools from existing frameworks (TCA, MVI)
- Developer preview program with feedback integration
- Gradual adoption path (can use Tier 1 without Tier 2/3)

#### **Performance Risks (Medium)**
**Risk**: Intelligence features may impact performance
**Mitigation**:
- Intelligence features are optional and configurable
- Performance budgets and monitoring
- Ability to disable intelligence in production if needed

#### **Ecosystem Risks (Low)**
**Risk**: iOS/SwiftUI integration challenges
**Mitigation**:
- Built on standard Swift/SwiftUI patterns
- Extensive iOS ecosystem testing
- Apple developer program engagement
