# Technical Specifications - Refinement Phase Reference

## üìã Overview

These specifications define the architecture and APIs implemented in Phase 1. During refinement phase, they serve as reference documentation for debugging and API improvements.

## üîß Specification Files

### Core Architecture
- **[API_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md](API_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Protocol definitions
  - **Use for**: Understanding existing API contracts when debugging
  - **Refinement focus**: API ergonomics improvements, error message enhancements

- **[DOMAIN_MODEL_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md](DOMAIN_MODEL_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md)** - Domain architecture
  - **Use for**: Understanding client-domain relationships in example apps
  - **Refinement focus**: Real-world pattern validation, common usage patterns

### System Components
- **[CAPABILITY_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md](CAPABILITY_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Capability validation
  - **Use for**: Debugging capability validation issues in example apps
  - **Refinement focus**: Performance optimization, API simplification

- **[INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md](INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md)** - AI features
  - **Use for**: Understanding intelligence integration when debugging
  - **Refinement focus**: Performance monitoring, feature usage patterns

- **[MACRO_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md](MACRO_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Code generation
  - **Use for**: Understanding macro behavior during debugging
  - **Refinement focus**: Error message improvements, generated code optimization

## üîç Refinement Phase Usage

### Debugging with Specs
1. **Issue occurs in example app** ‚Üí Check relevant spec for expected behavior
2. **API feels verbose** ‚Üí Check spec for simplification opportunities  
3. **Performance problem** ‚Üí Check spec for optimization guidance
4. **Error unclear** ‚Üí Check spec for better error message design

### API Evolution Notes
During refinement, these specs may be updated to reflect:
- **Convenience methods** added for common patterns
- **Error improvements** for better developer experience
- **Performance optimizations** discovered through profiling
- **Integration helpers** for common iOS patterns

### Validation Against Real Usage
Each spec should be validated against example app usage:
- ‚úÖ **API_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION** - Are the APIs ergonomic in practice?
- ‚úÖ **CAPABILITY_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION** - Is validation performant enough?
- ‚úÖ **DOMAIN_MODEL_DESIGN_PATTERNS** - Do patterns work in real apps?
- ‚úÖ **INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION** - Are intelligence features useful?
- ‚úÖ **MACRO_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION** - Do macros reduce real boilerplate?

## üìù Updating Specifications

### When to Update
- **API changes** based on refinement discoveries
- **Performance optimizations** that change behavior
- **New convenience methods** that improve ergonomics
- **Error handling improvements** that change interfaces

### Update Process
1. Make targeted framework changes
2. Validate in example apps
3. Update relevant specification
4. Document decision rationale
5. Test against other components
