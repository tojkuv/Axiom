# Axiom Framework

The world's first **Intelligent, Predictive Architectural Framework** for iOS development, designed for perfect human-AI collaboration.

## 🚀 Status: Stable Framework Ready!

The world's first intelligent, predictive architectural framework is **stable and validated**. Clean package build with working demonstration.

### ✅ **Stability Achieved**
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd Axiom
swift build  # ✅ Builds cleanly for ALL targets
```

### 🎯 **Working Features**
- **🧠 Intelligence Queries**: Ask AI about your architecture
- **⚡ Actor State Management**: Thread-safe with automatic UI updates  
- **🔄 SwiftUI Integration**: Reactive binding with 1:1 relationships
- **🔐 Runtime Capabilities**: Validation with graceful degradation
- **📊 Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and analysis

## 🎯 Mission

**Axiom** transforms iOS development through architectural intelligence with one core principle:  
**Humans make decisions, AI writes and maintains all code.**

## 🧠 Revolutionary Intelligence Features

### 8 Breakthrough Intelligence Systems
1. **Architectural DNA** - Complete component introspection and self-documentation
2. **Intent-Driven Evolution** - Predictive architecture evolution based on business intent
3. **Natural Language Queries** - Explore architecture in plain English
4. **Self-Optimizing Performance** - Continuous learning and automatic optimization
5. **Constraint Propagation** - Automatic business rule compliance (GDPR, PCI, etc.)
6. **Emergent Pattern Detection** - Learning and codifying new patterns
7. **Temporal Development Workflows** - Sophisticated experiment management
8. **Predictive Architecture Intelligence** - **THE BREAKTHROUGH** - Problem prevention before occurrence

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### The 8 Fundamental Constraints
1. **View-Context Relationship** (1:1 bidirectional binding)
2. **Context-Client Orchestration** (read-only state + cross-cutting concerns)
3. **Client Isolation** (single ownership with actor safety)
4. **Hybrid Capability System** (compile-time hints + 1-3% runtime validation)
5. **Domain Model Architecture** (1:1 client ownership with value objects)
6. **Cross-Domain Coordination** (context orchestration only)
7. **Unidirectional Flow** (Views → Contexts → Clients → Capabilities → System)
8. **Revolutionary Intelligence System** (8 breakthrough AI capabilities)

## ⚡ Performance Targets

### Foundation Performance (Tier 1)
- **50x faster** state access vs TCA
- **30% memory reduction** vs baseline
- **<3% runtime cost** capability system
- **60% faster** startup time

### Revolutionary Benefits (Tier 3)
- **10x development velocity** through predictive intelligence
- **90% problem prevention** through architectural foresight
- **Zero surprise development** - no unexpected architectural problems
- **120x faster** state access with full optimization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: 📱 **Run the Actual iOS App** (Recommended!)
```bash
# Open the runnable iOS application
cd Examples/ExampleApp
open ExampleApp.xcodeproj
# Add local package dependency to "../../" and run in simulator!
```
👆 **This gives you a real iOS app demonstrating all Axiom features!**  
📖 See [RUNNABLE_APP_GUIDE.md](RUNNABLE_APP_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Option 2: Stable Package Build
```bash
# Clone and build everything cleanly
git clone <repo>
cd Axiom
swift build  # ✅ All targets build successfully
```

### Option 3: Explore the Framework Code
```bash
# Build the framework components
swift build --target Axiom

# Explore in Xcode
open Package.swift
```

### Option 4: Integration
```swift
import Axiom

// Create an actor-based client
actor MyClient: AxiomClient {
    typealias State = MyState
    private(set) var stateSnapshot = MyState()
    let capabilities: CapabilityManager
}

// Create a reactive context
@MainActor
class MyContext: AxiomContext {
    let myClient: MyClient
    let intelligence: AxiomIntelligence
}

// Create a 1:1 SwiftUI view
struct MyView: AxiomView {
    @ObservedObject var context: MyContext
}
```
