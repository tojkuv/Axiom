# Production-Ready Testing Framework Implementation

**Status**: Critical Priority Proposal  
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Production Blocker  
**Branch Context**: Development  
**Implementation Timeline**: 3 weeks focused execution  
**Success Criteria**: >95% coverage, 100% test success rate, production readiness validation

## üéØ Executive Summary

Critical testing infrastructure gaps prevent Axiom Framework production deployment. Current 70% coverage with missing core protocol tests violates MANDATORY >95% requirement. This proposal establishes production-grade testing with focused 3-week implementation targeting immediate production readiness.

**PRODUCTION BLOCKER**: Missing unit tests for AxiomClient, AxiomContext, StateSnapshot protocols plus incomplete performance validation prevents framework release.

## üö® Critical Production Gaps

### **IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS (Week 1 Priority)**
- üî¥ **Core Protocol Tests MISSING**: AxiomClient, AxiomContext, StateSnapshot (30% coverage gap)
- üî¥ **Performance Claims UNVALIDATED**: 50x TCA improvement unproven, blocks marketing claims
- üî¥ **Actor Safety UNTESTED**: Concurrent access patterns lack validation infrastructure

### **DEVELOP.md Mandate Violations**
- **Coverage**: 70% actual vs 95% required (25% gap = production blocker)
- **Performance**: TCA comparison claims lack automated validation
- **Reliability**: No failure recovery testing infrastructure

### **Current Strengths (Keep & Build On)**
- ‚úÖ Mock infrastructure: MockCapabilityManager, MockAxiomIntelligence operational
