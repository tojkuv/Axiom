**Implementation Approach**: Incremental implementation with continuous validation to maintain framework stability while addressing critical gaps in core functionality and testing infrastructure.

**Risk Mitigation**: Phased approach ensures compilation and testing capability restored before implementing complex functionality, reducing development risk.

**Validation Strategy**: Each phase includes comprehensive testing to validate implementation before proceeding to dependent components.
