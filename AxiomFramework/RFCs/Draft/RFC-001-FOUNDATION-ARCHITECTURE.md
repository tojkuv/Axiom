## Abstract

This RFC establishes the foundation architecture for the Axiom framework, defining the complete architectural blueprint from inception to first release. It specifies six immutable component types, nineteen architectural constraints, core protocols, performance requirements, and implementation roadmap. This foundation ensures thread safety, testability, and maintainability by leveraging Swift's actor model for concurrency and SwiftUI for reactive UI updates.

The foundation architecture enforces clear boundaries between components through compile-time and runtime validation, preventing common iOS development issues such as race conditions, circular dependencies, and memory leaks. This document serves as the definitive reference for building Axiom from initial implementation through first stable release, establishing all architectural principles, protocols, and development milestones.

## Motivation

iOS development suffers from several recurring architectural problems:

1. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access to shared mutable state causes unpredictable behavior
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Components with bidirectional dependencies create maintenance nightmares
3. **Memory Leaks**: Retain cycles from improper ownership patterns waste resources
4. **Testing Difficulties**: Tightly coupled components resist isolation for unit testing
5. **State Inconsistency**: Multiple sources of truth lead to synchronization bugs

Current iOS architectures (MVC, MVVM, VIPER) address some issues but lack strict constraints and comprehensive foundations. Axiom provides a complete architectural foundation with immutable rules, defined protocols, performance targets, and clear development roadmap from inception to release.

## Specification

### Overview

The Axiom framework defines a complete iOS application architecture with six immutable component types, nineteen architectural constraints, and strict performance requirements. This specification is organized into the following sections:

1. **Component Architecture** - Component types and their relationships
2. **Architectural Constraints** - Rules governing component interactions
3. **Protocol Specifications** - Complete protocol requirements
4. **Performance Requirements** - Measurable performance targets
5. **Implementation Details** - Technical requirements and mechanisms

### Component Architecture

#### Component Types

The Axiom architecture consists of exactly six immutable component types:

| Component | Purpose | Dependencies | Thread Safety | Lifetime |
|-----------|---------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Capability** | External system access | Other Capabilities only | Thread-safe (actor/MainActor/synchronized) | Transient |
| **Owned State** | Domain model representation | None | Value types | Singleton |
| **Client** | Domain logic | Capabilities only | Actor isolation | Singleton |
| **Orchestrator** | Application lifecycle | Creates Contexts | @MainActor | Singleton |
| **Context** | Feature coordination | Clients & Contexts | @MainActor | Per view instance |
| **Presentation** | User interface | One Context | SwiftUI View | Multiple instances |

### Architectural Constraints

Nineteen constraints enforce architectural integrity through compile-time and runtime validation:

#### Dependency Constraints (Rules 1-8)

1. **Client Dependency**: Clients can ONLY depend on Capabilities
2. **Context Dependency**: Contexts can ONLY depend on Clients and downstream Contexts
3. **Capability Composition**: Capabilities can ONLY depend on other Capabilities (forming a DAG)
4. **View-Context Binding**: Each View has exactly ONE Context dependency
5. **Unidirectional Flow**: Dependencies flow: Orchestrator → Context → Client → Capability → System
6. **Client Isolation**: Clients cannot depend on other Clients
7. **State Ownership**: Each State is owned by exactly ONE Client
8. **Context Composition**: Contexts form a DAG with no circular dependencies

#### Lifetime Constraints (Rules 9-13)

9. **View Lifetime**: Multiple instances - new instance per usage in SwiftUI hierarchy
10. **Context Lifetime**: One instance per view instance - maintains 1:1 relationship
11. **Client Lifetime**: Singleton - one instance per client type for entire application
12. **State Lifetime**: Singleton - one instance per state type, paired 1:1 with client
13. **Capability Lifetime**: Transient - recreated when permissions or availability changes

#### State Management Constraints (Rules 14-19)

14. **State Mutation**: State mutations must be atomic and produce new immutable instances
15. **Error Propagation**: Errors must propagate upward through component hierarchy without skipping levels
16. **Capability Initialization**: Capability initialization must respect dependency order in the DAG
17. **State Composition**: States must contain only value types (structs, enums, primitive types)
18. **Action Definition**: Actions must be value types with clear command/query separation
19. **Error Boundaries**: Contexts act as error boundaries and must handle or explicitly propagate all Client errors

#### Constraint Dependencies

**Foundational Dependencies**:
- Rules 1-2 establish base dependency directions, enabling Rule 5 (unidirectional flow)
- Rules 6-7 establish ownership patterns, required for Rules 11-12 (singleton lifetimes)
- Rule 3 enables Rule 16 by establishing capability initialization order

**Lifetime Dependencies**:
- Rule 4 enforces Rule 10: View-Context binding requires matching lifetimes
- Rule 11 enables Rule 12: Singleton clients required for singleton state ownership
- Rule 13 is independent but coordinates with Rules 3 and 16 for capability lifecycle

**State Management Dependencies**:
- Rule 14 requires Rule 15: State mutation errors must propagate correctly
- Rule 17 enables Rule 14: Value types ensure atomic state mutations
- Rule 19 requires Rules 2 and 15: Contexts must be in hierarchy to act as boundaries

**Cross-Cutting Dependencies**:
- Rule 5 requires Rules 1-2 and enables clean testing boundaries
- Rule 8 requires Rule 2 but adds runtime cycle detection at context creation time
- Rules 14-19 form cohesive state management subsystem

### Protocol Specifications

The framework defines four primary protocols with error handling and state observation capabilities:

#### Capability Protocol

**Purpose**: Manages external system access with lifecycle management and degradation support.

**Required Members**:
- `isAvailable: Bool` - Current availability status
- `initialize() async throws` - Async initialization with error handling
- `invalidate()` - Resource cleanup (must complete in < 5ms)
- `capabilityIdentifier: String` - Unique identifier for dependency resolution
- `degradationLevel: DegradationLevel` - Current operational level (Full/Limited/Minimal/Unavailable)

**Optional Members**:
- `recoveryStrategy: RecoveryStrategy` - Default recovery strategy (retry/fallback/propagate/ignore)
- `requiresUserConsent: Bool` - Whether capability needs user permission

**Thread Safety**: Must be @MainActor, actor-isolated, or use explicit synchronization

**Versioning**: Protocol version checked at initialization via `capabilityVersion: String`

#### Client Protocol

**Purpose**: Actor-based business logic container with thread-safe state management.

**Required Members**:
- `stateStream: AsyncStream<State>` - State updates with 10-event buffer and coalescing
- `processAction(_ action: Action) async throws` - Action processing (must complete in < 8ms)
- `initialState: State` - Initial state value
- `clientIdentifier: String` - Unique identifier for dependency injection

**Required Associated Types**:
- `State: Sendable` - Must contain only value types (structs/enums/primitives)
- `Action: Sendable` - Value type with command/query separation

**AsyncStream Configuration**:
- Buffer size: 10 pending states (overflow triggers coalescing)
- Critical states: Marked with `priority: .critical` to prevent dropping
- Backpressure: Keep only latest state on overflow

#### Context Protocol

**Purpose**: MainActor-bound feature coordinator with error boundary capabilities.

**Required Members**:
- `observeClient() async` - Subscribe to client state stream with weak self reference
- `handleUserAction(_ action: UserAction) async` - Process user interactions
- `contextIdentifier: String` - Unique identifier for debugging

**Required Lifecycle Methods**:
- `onAppear()` - View appearance handling (must complete in < 10ms)
- `onDisappear()` - Cleanup and task cancellation (must complete in < 10ms)

**Error Boundary Requirements**:
- Must catch all Client errors in `observeClient()`
- Must implement recovery or explicit propagation
- "Handling" means: user notification, automatic retry, navigation fallback, or silent recovery
- "Propagating" means: re-throwing with context information

#### Orchestrator Protocol

**Purpose**: Application lifecycle coordinator with service-oriented architecture.

**Required Members**:
- `createContext(for view: ViewType) -> Context` - Factory method for context creation
- `handleCapabilityChange(_ change: CapabilityChange)` - System event handling
- `orchestratorVersion: String` - Version for compatibility checking

**Required Services** (as Capabilities):
- **ContextCreationService**: Factory registration and context instantiation
  - `registerFactory(for: ViewType, factory: @escaping () -> Context)`
  - `createContext(for: ViewType) -> Context?`
- **DependencyResolutionService**: Capability and client dependency injection
  - `register<T>(type: T.Type, factory: @escaping () -> T)`
  - `resolve<T>(type: T.Type) -> T?`
- **NavigationManagementService**: Navigation state and circular path detection
  - `navigate(to: ViewType)`
  - `detectCircularNavigation() -> Bool`

**System Event Monitoring**:
- Permission changes: biometrics, photos, notifications, camera, microphone, location
- Service availability: network, bluetooth, authentication, storage
- Thermal events: CPU throttling, background restrictions

#### Error Protocol Integration

All protocols incorporate `AxiomError` protocol with recovery strategies:

**AxiomError Requirements**:
- `errorCode: String` - Unique error identifier
- `userMessage: String` - Localized user-facing message
- `technicalDetails: String` - Developer-facing diagnostics
- `recoveryStrategies: [RecoveryStrategy]` - Available recovery options
- `severity: ErrorSeverity` - critical/high/medium/low

### Error Recovery Specification

#### Recovery Strategy Definitions

**Retry Strategy**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Initial delay: 100ms, max delay: 5s, max attempts: 3
- Timeout per attempt: 30s

**Fallback Strategy**:
- Return cached/default data with metadata
- Staleness indicator required
- Cache TTL: Configuration-dependent

**Propagate Strategy**:
- Forward error with context to caller
- Preserve original error chain
- Add component-specific context

**Ignore Strategy**:
- Log error with severity level
- Continue execution
- Only for non-critical operations

#### Component-Specific Recovery Patterns

**Capability Recovery**:
- Transient failures → Retry with backoff
- Permission denied → Fallback to cached data
- Service unavailable → Propagate to Client
- Non-critical errors → Ignore with logging

**Client Recovery**:
- State mutation failure → Rollback to previous state
- Partial action failure → Apply valid portions only
- Critical errors → Transition to error state
- Capability degradation → Graceful functionality reduction

**Context Recovery**:
- User action failure → Present error UI with retry option
- State observation error → Automatic reconnection attempt
- Navigation error → Fallback to safe view
- Non-critical errors → Silent recovery with logging

**Orchestrator Recovery**:
- Capability graph failure → Reinitialize affected subgraph
- Multiple failures → Partial shutdown mode
- Critical system failure → Emergency mode with user consent
- All failures → Diagnostic data collection

### Component Initialization Order

**Bootstrap Sequence**:
1. **Capability Graph Construction**: Build DAG from capability dependencies
2. **Capability Initialization**: Initialize in topological order
3. **Client Creation**: Create singleton clients with initialized capabilities
4. **Orchestrator Setup**: Initialize with capability and client references
5. **Context Factory Registration**: Register context creation functions
6. **View Hierarchy Setup**: SwiftUI app initialization

**Initialization Failure Handling**:
- **Capability Failure**: Mark as unavailable, continue with degraded mode
- **Required Capability Failure**: Halt initialization, present error UI
- **Client Failure**: Log error, skip dependent features
- **Orchestrator Failure**: Fatal error, app cannot continue

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Thread Safety**: All Clients must guarantee thread-safe state access; all Contexts must execute on the main UI thread
2. **State Management**: States must be value types with immutable snapshots
3. **Memory Management**: Contexts must prevent retain cycles when observing state changes
4. **Navigation Safety**: Navigation management must detect and prevent circular navigation paths
5. **Capability Lifecycle**: Capabilities must handle initialization/invalidation
6. **Testing Support**: Framework must provide testing utilities for capability simulation, client stubbing, and orchestration control
7. **Error Handling**: All components must implement error handling with recovery strategies
8. **State Observation**: Clients must expose state updates via `stateStream: AsyncStream<State>` property
9. **Performance**: Components must meet defined performance targets (see Performance Requirements section)
10. **Validation Enforcement**: Each constraint must specify compile-time or runtime enforcement mechanism
11. **Capability Thread Safety**: Capabilities must either be @MainActor, actor-isolated, or use explicit synchronization
12. **Component Destruction Order**: Component destruction must follow reverse dependency order: Views → Contexts → Clients → Capabilities
13. **Protocol Versioning**: All protocols must expose version string for compatibility checking

### State Observation Mechanism

Clients publish state changes through AsyncStream, allowing Contexts to observe and react to state updates. The pattern ensures unidirectional data flow while maintaining thread safety:

- **Client State Publishing**: Clients expose state changes via AsyncStream, yielding new states after processing actions
- **Context Observation**: Contexts subscribe to client state streams using weak self references in tasks
- **Lifecycle Management**: Observation tasks are cancelled when views disappear, preventing memory leaks
- **Thread Safety**: Actor isolation in Clients and MainActor binding in Contexts ensure safe concurrent access


### Capability Lifecycle Triggers

Capabilities invalidate and reinitialize based on system events:

**Permission Changes**: When users revoke permissions (biometrics, photos, notifications, camera, microphone, location), capabilities must invalidate and provide fallbacks following this hierarchy:
1. Return cached data with staleness indicator
2. Return empty data with unavailability reason
3. Trigger user notification for manual resolution

**Service Availability**: Network connectivity loss triggers offline mode with cached data usage. Authentication token expiration requires re-authentication. Other services (bluetooth, storage) follow similar patterns.

**Monitoring Implementation**: The Orchestrator monitors system notifications and network path updates to detect capability changes, invoking appropriate handlers to maintain system consistency.

### Capability Taxonomy

Capabilities are classified into four categories with specific requirements:

**System Capabilities**:
- Access device features (camera, microphone, location, biometrics)
- Permission-based lifecycle with user consent requirements
- Must handle permission revocation gracefully

**Network Capabilities**:
- External service communication (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Connectivity-aware with offline fallback support
- Must implement request queuing for offline-to-online transitions

**Storage Capabilities**:
- Local data persistence (files, databases, keychain)
- Space-aware with cleanup strategies
- Must handle storage pressure events

**Computation Capabilities**:
- Resource-intensive operations (image processing, ML inference)
- Battery and thermal aware
- Must support operation cancellation and progress reporting

### Partial Capability Degradation

Capabilities support degraded operation modes:

**Degradation Levels**:
1. **Full**: All features available with normal performance
2. **Limited**: Core features only, reduced performance acceptable
3. **Minimal**: Critical features only, user notification required
4. **Unavailable**: No features, must fail gracefully

**Negotiation Protocol**:
- Clients query capability degradation level before use
- Capabilities advertise current level via `degradationLevel` property
- Contexts adjust UI based on available capability levels
- Orchestrator tracks system-wide degradation for coordinated response

### Enhanced State Observation

**Backpressure Handling**:
- AsyncStream buffers limited to 10 pending states
- Overflow triggers state coalescing (keep only latest)
- Contexts can request replay of missed states
- Critical state changes marked as non-droppable

**Observation Guarantees**:
- Order preservation: States delivered in mutation order
- Delivery confirmation: Contexts acknowledge critical states
- Cancellation safety: Clean task termination without state loss
- Recovery support: Contexts can resume observation after errors

### Testing Infrastructure

**Testing Utilities**:
- **Capability Simulation**: Mock capabilities with configurable availability, degradation levels, and failure modes
- **Client Stubbing**: Predefined state sequences with timing control for deterministic testing
- **Orchestration Control**: Dependency injection overrides and lifecycle event simulation
- **Performance Harness**: Automated measurement with statistical analysis and regression detection

**CircularDependencyDetector**:
- Algorithm: Depth-first search with cycle detection
- Execution: During Context creation in Orchestrator
- Performance: O(n) where n = number of Contexts
- Output: Throws `CircularDependencyError` with cycle path

**Debug Inspection APIs**:
- `debugDescription`: Dependency graph visualization
- `dumpState()`: Current component state snapshot
- `traceDependencies()`: Live dependency path tracing
- `performanceMetrics()`: Real-time performance data

**Test Categories**:

**Unit Tests**: Verify individual component behavior
- State transition correctness in Clients
- Error propagation through component hierarchy  
- Recovery strategy selection and execution
- Capability degradation handling
- Thread safety validation with race condition detection

**Integration Tests**: Validate component interactions
- Complete user flows from View to Capability
- Cross-component error handling
- State synchronization across multiple contexts
- Capability lifecycle during permission changes
- Navigation flow integrity

**Performance Tests**: Ensure targets are met
- Context creation: initialization to ready state (<50ms)
- State propagation: actor dispatch to view render (<16ms)
- Memory overhead: framework allocations only (<1KB/context)
- Capability checks: cached access performance (<1ms)
- Error recovery: strategy determination time (<5ms)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Debugging Support
- Framework must provide debug descriptions for all components showing dependency graphs
- Components must expose runtime inspection APIs for development builds
- Debug builds include performance profiling with automatic violation detection

#### Observability Requirements
- Framework must expose metrics for: component creation/destruction, error rates, performance violations
- Metrics accessible through `MetricsProvider` protocol:
  - `componentMetrics()`: Creation/destruction counts
  - `errorMetrics()`: Error rates by component type
  - `performanceMetrics()`: Violation counts and durations

#### Framework Versioning
- All protocols expose `protocolVersion: String` for compatibility checking
- Version format: `major.minor.patch` (semantic versioning)
- Compatibility matrix maintained in `VersionCompatibility.swift`
- Mismatches fail at initialization with suggested migration path

#### Backward Compatibility Testing
- Test suite validates protocol version compatibility
- Migration tests ensure upgrade paths work correctly
- Performance regression tests compare versions
- API stability tests prevent breaking changes

### Constraint Enforcement Mechanisms

| Constraint | Enforcement Method | Validation Time |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Rules 1-7 | Type system | Compile-time |
| Rule 8 | CircularDependencyDetector | Runtime |
| Rules 9-10 | Framework lifecycle management | Runtime |
| Rules 11-13 | Object lifetime tracking | Runtime |
| Rules 14-16 | Protocol requirements | Compile-time |
| Rules 17-19 | Type system + protocol requirements | Compile-time |

**Performance Enforcement**: Performance violations must trigger warnings in DEBUG builds and errors in RELEASE builds.

### Migration Guide

**From MVVM**: Transform ViewModels into Contexts, Services into Capabilities, and Models into State+Client pairs. Move @Published properties from ViewModels to Contexts while keeping business logic in actor-based Clients.

**From MVC**: Replace ViewControllers with SwiftUI Views and Contexts. Move service calls to Capabilities accessed through Clients. Transition from callback-based to async/await patterns.

**Key Migration Points**:
- ViewModels/Controllers become Contexts
- Services become Capabilities 
- Models split into immutable State and actor-based Clients
- Use @Published in Contexts for UI binding
- Navigation managed by Orchestrator's navigation management capability
- Dependencies injected via Orchestrator's dependency resolution capability

## Performance Requirements

### Overview

Performance requirements ensure responsive user experience and efficient resource usage. All targets are measured on iOS 15+ with A12 Bionic or newer processors unless specified otherwise.

### Component Performance Targets

#### Capability Performance
- **Initialization**: First check may take up to 10ms; subsequent checks must use cached results and complete in < 1ms
- **Invalidation**: Resource cleanup must complete in < 5ms
- **Recovery Strategy**: Strategy determination must complete in < 5ms (excluding execution)
- **Configuration Reload**: Hot-reload of configuration must complete in < 20ms without capability recreation

#### Client Performance
- **State Mutation**: Processing actions to produce new state must complete in < 8ms
- **State Publishing**: AsyncStream notification dispatch must occur within 1ms of state change
- **Memory**: Actor overhead must be < 512 bytes per instance (excluding state data)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Support minimum 100 concurrent state observations without degradation

#### Context Performance
- **Creation**: Context initialization must complete in < 50ms
- **State Observation**: State change receipt from Client must occur within 8ms of dispatch
- **Memory**: Framework overhead must be < 1KB per instance (excluding stored properties)
- **Lifecycle**: onAppear/onDisappear handlers must complete in < 10ms

#### View Performance
- **Rendering**: State mutation to UI update must complete in < 16ms (60fps requirement)
- **Navigation**: View transitions must complete in < 300ms (iOS standard animation)
- **Memory**: SwiftUI view body computation must use < 256KB stack space
- **Layout**: Complex view hierarchies (>100 views) must layout in < 33ms

### Measurement Methodology

**Performance Boundaries**:
- State propagation: From actor queue dispatch to SwiftUI render completion
- Memory overhead: Framework-specific allocations excluding application data
- Capability checks: Differentiate first-time initialization from cached access
- Error recovery: Time from error detection to recovery strategy execution

**Testing Conditions**:
- Device: iOS 15+ on A12 Bionic minimum (older devices may have relaxed targets)
- Memory: Measured with Instruments memory profiler
- Timing: Measured with os_signpost intervals
- Concurrency: Tested under load with 100+ simultaneous operations

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**iOS Performance**:
- Primary platform with strictest requirements
- ProMotion displays require 8ms frame budget for 120fps
- Background execution limited to 30s continuous

**macOS Performance**:
- Relaxed view transition target: < 500ms
- No background execution limits
- Higher memory allowance: 2KB per Context

**watchOS Performance**:
- Stricter targets: State mutation < 4ms
- Reduced memory: 256 bytes per Context
- Limited concurrent operations: 10 maximum

**Technical Limitations**:
- AsyncStream state observation has inherent latency (1-3ms) due to actor queue scheduling
- Context memory measurement excludes Swift runtime overhead which varies by platform
- Thermal throttling may increase all targets by up to 3x under sustained load

## Platform Support

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Minimum Version | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------|-------|
| iOS | 15.0 | Primary | Full feature support |
| macOS | 12.0 | Secondary | Desktop optimizations |
| watchOS | 8.0 | Experimental | Limited capabilities |
| tvOS | 15.0 | Planned | Not yet implemented |

### Platform-Specific Adaptations

**iOS Specifics**:
- Full SwiftUI integration
- All capability types supported
- Background task coordination
- ProMotion display support

**macOS Specifics**:
- AppKit bridge for legacy components
- Multi-window coordination
- File system capabilities enhanced
- No camera/location restrictions

**watchOS Specifics**:
- Simplified Context lifecycle
- Reduced capability set (no camera)
- Complication update integration
- Extended runtime sessions

### Cross-Platform Considerations

**Conditional Compilation**:
```
#if os(iOS)
// iOS-specific capability implementation
#elseif os(macOS)
// macOS-specific capability implementation
#elseif os(watchOS)
// watchOS-specific capability implementation
#endif
```

**Shared Components**:
- Core protocols identical across platforms
- Performance targets adjusted per platform
- Platform-specific capabilities conditionally available

## Configuration Management

### Configuration Architecture

**Configuration Injection**:
- Capabilities accept configuration via init parameters
- Configuration changes without recompilation via property lists
- Environment-based configuration switching

**Hot-Reload Support**:
- Configuration changes detected via file system monitoring
- Capabilities notified of configuration updates
- Non-permission changes applied without recreation

**Configuration Scope**:
- **Global**: Application-wide settings (API endpoints, feature flags)
- **Capability**: Component-specific settings (timeout values, retry counts)
- **Environment**: Development/staging/production variants

### Configuration Change Handling

**Reload Triggers**:
- File system change detection
- Push notification from configuration service
- Manual reload via debug menu
- App foreground transition

**Reload Process**:
1. Detect configuration change
2. Validate new configuration
3. Notify affected capabilities
4. Apply changes without service interruption
5. Log configuration transition

**Limitations**:
- Permission-based changes require capability recreation
- Some network configurations require connection reset
- UI-affecting changes may require view refresh

## Rationale

### Design Decisions

1. **Actor-Based Clients**: Swift's actor model provides thread safety without manual locking, eliminating data races by design.

2. **1:1 View-Context Relationship**: Each view instance gets its own context instance, preventing state bleeding between views and enabling proper lifecycle management.

3. **Singleton Clients**: Single source of truth for each domain ensures synchronization across all observers without explicit coordination code.

4. **Transient Capabilities**: System permissions and availability change at runtime; transient lifecycle allows graceful handling of these changes.

5. **Service-Oriented Orchestrator**: Orchestrator must provide context creation capability, dependency resolution capability, and navigation management capability to enable focused testing and clear responsibilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Shared Contexts**: Rejected due to complexity of managing multiple view lifecycles
2. **Direct View-Client Binding**: Rejected as it violates separation of concerns
3. **Manual Thread Synchronization**: Rejected in favor of actor model simplicity
4. **Static Capability Instances**: Rejected due to inability to handle permission changes

## Backwards Compatibility

As the foundational RFC for Axiom, this specification establishes the baseline architecture from which all future development proceeds. All subsequent RFCs must maintain compatibility with this foundation architecture.

Framework is currently in MVP stage - breaking changes are acceptable until version 1.0 release.

## Security Considerations

1. **Actor Isolation**: Prevents concurrent access to mutable state
2. **Capability Validation**: Runtime checks ensure system access is authorized
3. **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation prevents many security issues
4. **Memory Safety**: Clear ownership rules prevent use-after-free bugs
