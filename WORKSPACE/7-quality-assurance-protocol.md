# CODEBASE-QUALITY-ASSURANCE-PROTOCOL

Perform comprehensive quality assessment of codebase through exhaustive testing, analysis, and validation to determine readiness state and recommend next development cycle phase.

## Activation
```
@CODEBASE_QUALITY_ASSURANCE execute <codebase_directory> [context_file]
```

*Note: The codebase directory is the path to codebase for comprehensive quality assessment. Optional context file provides additional context about the codebase, quality requirements, and assessment priorities.*

## Input Requirements
**Required Parameters:**
- **codebase_directory**: Path to codebase for comprehensive quality assessment

**Optional Parameters:**
- **context_file**: Optional context file providing additional context about the codebase, quality requirements, and assessment priorities

**Expected Codebase Structure:**
The protocol can work with any codebase structure and will adapt testing strategies accordingly.

## Process
1. **Context** - Read context file (if provided) to understand quality requirements, assessment priorities, and project-specific constraints
2. **Discover** - Analyze codebase structure, frameworks, and existing testing infrastructure
3. **Baseline** - Establish current quality metrics and testing coverage
4. **Test Audit** - Comprehensive review of existing tests (unit, integration, performance, security)
5. **Test Enhancement** - Add, remove, update, or replace tests to achieve comprehensive coverage
6. **Quality Analysis** - Perform deep code quality, security, performance, and completeness analysis
7. **Validation** - Execute comprehensive test suites and collect quality metrics
8. **Assessment** - Evaluate readiness state using quality assessment framework
9. **Report** - Generate comprehensive quality report with next phase recommendations
