# PROVISIONER-PROTOCOL

Establish foundational infrastructure for parallel development with zero-defect foundation, supporting both expansion enhancements and critical stabilization work, replacing legacy implementations with modern solutions.

## Activation
```
@CODEBASE_PROVISIONER execute <workspace_directory> [context_file]
```

*Note: The workspace directory contains requirements and artifacts. Optional context file provides additional context about the codebase and project.*

## Process
1. **Context** - Read context file (if provided) to understand project specifics, constraints, and priorities
2. **Review** - Check ARTIFACTS directory for previous provisioner sessions to determine continuation points
3. **Analyze** - Read foundational requirements from ARTIFACTS covering both expansion and stabilization requirements
4. **Plan** - Determine current session scope based on previous sessions, outstanding requirements, and context guidance, prioritizing critical stabilization over enhancements
5. **Implement** - Build critical infrastructure and core patterns to support both worker types, replacing legacy implementations with modern solutions
6. **Test** - Create comprehensive test coverage and validation for foundation
7. **Validate** - Ensure zero build errors and test failures before worker activation
8. **Document** - Generate session artifact in ARTIFACTS directory for both expansion and stabilization workers

## Outputs
- Stable project foundation ready for parallel development of both enhancements and critical fixes
- Core APIs and shared components implemented to support expansion and stabilization
- Testing framework and development tools configured for both worker types
- Session artifact: `ARTIFACTS/PROVISIONER-SESSION-{TIMESTAMP}.md`
- Architectural decisions documented for both expansion and stabilization workers
- Foundation infrastructure enabling isolated worker development

## Success Criteria
- Foundation supports all planned technical areas for both expansion and stabilization
- Build system works reliably across configurations with zero critical issues
- Testing framework enables effective development for enhancement and fix work
- Infrastructure ready for parallel worker deployment
- Critical dependencies resolved before worker activation
