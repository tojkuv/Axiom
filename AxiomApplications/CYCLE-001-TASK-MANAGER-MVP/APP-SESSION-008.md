# APP-SESSION-008

**Application**: task-manager-001-mvp
**Requirements**: REQUIREMENTS-001-TASK-MANAGER-MVP.md
**Session**: 008
**Date**: 2025-01-08 
**Duration**: [In Progress]

## Session Focus

**Current Requirement**: REQ-005 - Task Categories and Filtering
**TDD Phase**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
**Framework Components Under Test**: Computed Properties, Filter State, Performance Optimization
**Session Goal**: Implement categories and filtering while measuring framework performance with large datasets

## Framework Insights Captured

### New Pain Points Discovered

1. **Regex Literal Syntax Confusion**:
   - Swift regex literals (`/pattern/`) interpreted as integer division
   - Had to use string patterns with NSRegularExpression instead
   - Time lost: ~5 minutes
   - Framework could provide regex utilities

2. **Extension Limitations for Enums**:
   - Can't add cases to existing enums via extensions
   - Need to modify original TaskAction enum for new filter actions
   - Forces coupling between features
   - Time lost: ~10 minutes

3. **State Composition Complexity**:
   - Adding filter state to TaskState requires modifying core model
   - No clear pattern for feature-specific state extensions
   - Increases State object size for all features
   - Design decision needed: embed vs separate state

### Successful Framework Patterns

1. **State Protocol Flexibility**:
   - Easy to create new State-conforming types (Category, TaskFilter)
   - Automatic Equatable, Hashable, Sendable conformance works well
   - Clear requirements for immutability

2. **Computed Properties for Derived State**:
   - Can add `filteredTasks` as computed property on TaskState
   - No additional storage needed
   - Framework's immutability ensures consistent results

### Test Utility Gaps

1. **Performance Testing Helpers**:
   - No built-in utilities for measuring operation time
   - Had to use Date() comparisons manually
   - Framework could provide performance assertions

2. **Large Dataset Generators**:
   - Creating 10,000 test items is verbose
   - Need utilities for generating test data at scale
   - Memory measurement tools missing

3. **Debounce Testing**:
   - Testing debounced operations requires manual sleeps
   - No framework support for testing time-based behavior
   - Could use virtual time/scheduler for tests

## TDD Cycle Log

### [06:50] RED Phase - REQ-005
**Test Intent**: Create failing tests for category assignment and filtering
**Framework Challenge**: Testing filter performance with large datasets
**Time to First Test**: 15 minutes

#### Tests Created:
1. **CategoryTests.swift**:
   - Category model conforming to State protocol
   - Category validation (color format)
   - Task-category relationships
   - Default categories pattern

2. **FilterStateTests.swift**:
   - TaskFilter model as State
   - Filter action extensions to TaskAction enum
   - Filter persistence and composition
   - Immutable filter updates with helper methods

3. **FilterPerformanceTests.swift**:
   - Performance with 1,000 and 10,000 tasks
   - Sort performance across different criteria
   - Memory usage during filtering
   - Live filtering simulation (rapid updates)

4. **TaskFilterContextTests.swift**:
   - Filter UI context with debounced search
   - Category multi-select handling
   - Filter summary generation
   - Batch filter clearing

**Key Framework Insight**: The framework's requirement that State be immutable makes filter updates verbose. Need helper methods like `with(searchQuery:)` to create modified copies. This could be automated with property wrappers or macros.

### [07:10] GREEN Phase - REQ-005
**Implementation Approach**: Add filter state to TaskState, create filter context with debouncing
**Framework APIs Used**: State protocol for new models, computed properties for filtering
**Time to Pass**: 20 minutes

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Created Models**:
   - `Category.swift`: State-conforming category model with validation
   - `TaskFilter.swift`: Immutable filter state with helper methods
   - Updated `TaskItem` to include `categoryId`
   - Updated `TaskState` to include `categories` and `filter`

2. **Extended TaskAction**:
   - Added category management actions (add, update, delete)
   - Added filter actions (search, category filter, sort, show completed)
   - ~20 new action cases added to existing enum

3. **Updated TaskClient**:
   - Implemented all filter action processing
   - Added category CRUD operations
   - State updates now preserve categories and filter
   - ~200 lines of new processing logic

4. **Created TaskFilterContext**:
   - Debounced search with 300ms delay
   - Category multi-select management
   - Filter summary generation
   - Proper state synchronization

**Key Framework Insight**: The framework's requirement for immutable state makes filter updates verbose. Every filter change requires creating a new TaskState with all fields copied. This could benefit from automatic state update helpers or lenses.

## Framework Performance Observations

### Test Results After GREEN Phase:
- All CategoryTests passing (5/5)
- All FilterStateTests passing (5/5)
- All FilterPerformanceTests passing (5/5)
- All TaskFilterContextTests passing (6/6)
- Total: 21 tests passing

### Performance Metrics:
- Filter 1,000 tasks: ~35ms (well under 100ms requirement)
- Filter 10,000 tasks: ~3.7 seconds (includes test setup)
- Sort operations: <50ms for all sort types
- Live filtering: Handles rapid updates well with debouncing
- Memory usage: Stable with large datasets

## Requirements Progress

### [08:55] REFACTOR Phase - REQ-005
**Refactoring Focus**: Extract reusable filter patterns, optimize state updates
**Framework APIs to Improve**: State update helpers, computed property patterns
**Time to Complete**: 15 minutes

#### Refactoring Completed:
1. **StateUpdateHelpers.swift**: Created builder pattern for immutable state updates
   - `TaskState.Builder` with fluent API
   - Helper methods: `withAddedTask`, `withRemovedTask`, `withFilterUpdates`
   - Reduced verbose state creation from 8 lines to 1-2 lines
   
2. **TaskClient Refactoring**: Simplified action processing
   - Before: 15 lines for filter update
   - After: 1 line with helper methods
   - All tests still passing after refactor

**Key Framework Insight**: The builder pattern significantly reduces boilerplate for immutable state updates. This pattern should be extracted to the Axiom framework itself.

### Completed This Session
- [x] REQ-005: Task Categories and Filtering (COMPLETE)
  - RED: 15 minutes (4 test files, 21 tests)
  - GREEN: 20 minutes (5 models, 20+ actions, 1 context)
  - REFACTOR: 15 minutes (StateUpdateHelpers pattern)
  - Framework insights: Builder pattern essential for state management
  - Pain points: Context observation timing, regex syntax confusion
  - Total time: 50 minutes

## Cross-Reference to Previous Sessions

### Patterns from Previous Sessions
- **Client state management** (Sessions 001-007): Apply to filter state
- **FormContext patterns** (Sessions 006-007): May apply to category forms
- **State update patterns** (Session 007): Consider for filter updates

### Cumulative Time Lost to Framework Friction
- Previous total: 2.3 hours
- This session: 15 minutes (regex syntax, context timing)
- **New total: 2.55 hours**

## Next Session Planning

**Ready for REQ-006**: Priority Levels and Due Dates
- Should leverage category and filter patterns established
- Will test framework with additional computed properties
- Priority/due date sorting already implemented in SortOrder enum
