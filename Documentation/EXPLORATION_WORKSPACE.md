## üîç Current Architecture Summary

### Core Constraints (Immutable Unless Changed)
1. **View-Context Relationship**: 1:1 bidirectional binding
2. **Context-Client Orchestration**: Read-only state access via snapshots  
3. **Client Isolation**: Single ownership with actor safety
4. **Capability System**: WASM-inspired zero-cost abstractions
5. **Unidirectional Flow**: Views ‚Üí Contexts ‚Üí Clients ‚Üí Capabilities

### Performance Targets
- **State Access**: 150x faster than TCA
- **Capability Usage**: Zero runtime cost
- **Memory Efficiency**: 40% reduction
- **Startup Performance**: 60% improvement

### Key Innovations
- **Perfect Human-AI Collaboration**: Humans decide, AI implements
- **Interrupt-Driven Development**: Graceful task switching
- **Git-Inspired Versioning**: Component versioning with rollback
- **Compile-Time Safety**: All constraints enforced at compile time

## üé≠ Exploration Areas

### 1. Architecture Refinements
**Current Focus**: Validating core constraints against real-world usage

#### Potential Discussion Points:
- **Context Orchestration Complexity**: Should contexts be allowed to communicate?
- **Client Isolation Trade-offs**: Is complete isolation always optimal?
- **Capability Granularity**: Fine-grained vs coarse-grained permissions
- **Error Propagation Strategy**: How should errors flow through the architecture?

#### Questions for Exploration:
- Are there scenarios where the constraints are too restrictive?
- Could simplified patterns improve developer ergonomics?
- Are there performance optimizations that require constraint adjustments?

### 2. Developer Experience Enhancements
**Current Focus**: Balancing architectural purity with practical usability

#### Potential Discussion Points:
- **Macro System Complexity**: How much boilerplate elimination is optimal?
- **Debug Experience**: What debugging tools are essential?
- **Migration Path**: How complex should TCA ‚Üí Axiom migration be?
- **Learning Curve**: What documentation/tooling reduces adoption friction?

#### Questions for Exploration:
- Which constraints cause the most developer friction?
- Are there patterns that could be simplified without compromising safety?
- What IDE integration features would be most valuable?

### 3. Performance Trade-offs
**Current Focus**: Validating aggressive performance targets

#### Potential Discussion Points:
- **Memory vs Speed**: Are current targets realistic for all use cases?
- **Compile Time**: Will extensive macro usage slow builds unacceptably?
- **Binary Size**: How much framework overhead is acceptable?
- **Runtime Overhead**: Are there scenarios where zero-cost abstractions break down?

#### Questions for Exploration:
- Should performance targets be adjusted for different app sizes?
- Are there trade-offs worth making for better developer experience?
- Which performance metrics are most critical for different app types?

### 4. iOS Ecosystem Integration
**Current Focus**: Ensuring seamless SwiftUI and iOS framework integration

#### Potential Discussion Points:
- **SwiftUI Compatibility**: How tightly should integration be?
- **Combine Integration**: Should reactive programming patterns be built-in?
- **iOS Framework Access**: How should UIKit/system frameworks be accessed?
- **Testing Integration**: How should XCTest integration work?

#### Questions for Exploration:
- Are there iOS patterns that don't fit the current architecture?
- Should the framework support legacy UIKit patterns?
- How important is backward compatibility with existing iOS approaches?

## üõ†Ô∏è Change Proposal Process

### Step 1: Identify Area for Change
Choose from the exploration areas above or propose a new area

### Step 2: Document Current State
Clearly describe what the current architecture/requirement specifies

### Step 3: Propose Specific Change
