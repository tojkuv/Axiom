## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Status

### Core Constraints (Optimized Architecture)
- **View-Context Relationship**: 1:1 bidirectional binding ‚úÖ
- **Context-Client Orchestration**: Read-only state access via snapshots + supervised cross-cutting ‚úÖ  
- **Client Isolation**: Single ownership with actor safety ‚úÖ
- **Capability System**: Hybrid WASM-inspired validation (compile-time + runtime) ‚úÖ
- **Versioning System**: Intelligent granularity based on component importance ‚úÖ
- **Unidirectional Flow**: Views ‚Üí Contexts ‚Üí Clients ‚Üí Capabilities ‚úÖ

### Performance Targets (Optimized)
- **State Access**: 120x faster than TCA ‚úÖ (revised for realistic hybrid approach)
- **Capability Usage**: 1-3% runtime cost for massive dev velocity gains ‚úÖ
- **Memory Efficiency**: 50% reduction vs current architecture ‚úÖ (improved)
- **Storage Efficiency**: 60-80% reduction in development overhead ‚úÖ (new)
- **Framework Size**: 45% reduction (5-12MB vs 9-22MB) ‚úÖ (new)
- **Startup Performance**: 60% improvement ‚úÖ (maintained)

### Human-AI Collaboration Model (From Original Planning)
- **Perfect Separation**: Humans decide, AI implements ‚úÖ
- **Interrupt-Driven**: Graceful task switching ‚úÖ
- **Dynamic Requests**: Any task can be modified mid-execution ‚úÖ
- **Buildable State**: Always maintain compilable code ‚úÖ

## üéØ Requirement Exploration Areas

### Areas Open for Refinement
- [ ] **Performance Trade-offs**: Balance between safety and speed
- [ ] **Developer Experience**: Ergonomics vs architectural purity
- [ ] **Capability Granularity**: Fine-grained vs coarse-grained permissions
- [ ] **Error Handling Strategy**: Explicit vs automatic error propagation
- [ ] **Testing Approach**: Generated vs manual test coverage
- [ ] **Migration Complexity**: Automatic vs manual TCA conversion

### Change Impact Assessment Framework
- [ ] **Architectural Consistency**: How changes affect core constraints
- [ ] **Performance Implications**: Impact on speed/memory targets  
- [ ] **Implementation Complexity**: Development time estimates
- [ ] **Human-AI Workflow**: Effects on collaboration patterns
- [ ] **Ecosystem Integration**: SwiftUI/iOS compatibility
