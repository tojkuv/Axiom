# @WORKSPACE.md - Axiom Framework Workspace Management Command

Framework workspace management command that creates and manages git worktrees for development

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@WORKSPACE [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute framework workspace management workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@WORKSPACE`** ‚Üí Show current workspace status and configuration
- **`@WORKSPACE setup`** ‚Üí Initialize framework and application worktrees for parallel development
- **`@WORKSPACE reset`** ‚Üí Reset and recreate worktrees with clean state
- **`@WORKSPACE status`** ‚Üí Show detailed worktree status and branch information
- **`@WORKSPACE cleanup`** ‚Üí Remove and cleanup all development worktrees

### Framework Workspace Scope
**Workspace Focus**: Git worktree creation and management for parallel framework and application development
**Branch Independence**: Creates isolated development environments on permanent branches
**Development Integration**: Enables simultaneous framework and application development
**Real-time Sync**: Framework changes immediately available to application workspace

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: WORKSPACE commands perform git worktree operations for development setup
**Version Control**: WORKSPACE creates isolated development environments, @CHECKPOINT handles commits
**Work Philosophy**: WORKSPACE creates development environments ‚Üí Parallel development in worktrees ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT integrates

Workspace commands manage development infrastructure:
1. **Worktree Creation**: Create framework-workspace/ and application-workspace/ directories
2. **Branch Assignment**: Permanent branch assignment (framework, application) to each worktree
3. **Integration Setup**: Real-time framework-application connection via symlinks
4. **Environment Validation**: Verify worktree functionality and development readiness
**Git Operations**: WORKSPACE commands create worktrees and manage development infrastructure

## Framework Workspace Management Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Framework workspace management eliminates branch switching friction by creating permanent development environments for parallel framework and application development. Each workspace maintains complete development context.

**Workspace Workflow**: @WORKSPACE creates worktrees ‚Üí Developers work in isolated environments ‚Üí Real-time integration via symlinks ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT integrates changes

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **WORKSPACE**: Creates and manages worktree infrastructure ‚Üí NO development work
- **PLAN/DEVELOP/etc**: Work within designated worktrees ‚Üí NO worktree management
- **CHECKPOINT**: Commits and integrates from worktrees ‚Üí NO worktree creation
- **Development**: Occurs entirely within worktree boundaries ‚Üí NO branch switching

**Quality Standards**: Workspace management ensures clean development isolation, real-time integration, and parallel development capability

**Technical Focus Only**: Workspace management strictly focuses on development infrastructure setup. No consideration of non-technical aspects (community involvement, adoption, marketing, business strategy, user engagement, etc.)

## Framework Workspace Management Methodology

### Phase 1: Workspace Environment Analysis
1. **Current State Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze existing git repository and branch structure

5. **Integration Planning** ‚Üí Plan real-time framework-application integration approach

### Phase 2: Worktree Infrastructure Creation
1. **Cleanup Existing Worktrees** ‚Üí Remove any existing worktree configurations
2. **Framework Workspace Creation** ‚Üí Create framework-workspace/ with framework branch
3. **Application Workspace Creation** ‚Üí Create application-workspace/ with application branch
4. **Real-time Integration Setup** ‚Üí Create symlinks for framework-application connection
5. **Environment Validation** ‚Üí Verify worktree functionality and development readiness

### Phase 3: Workspace Configuration and Documentation
1. **Development Environment Setup** ‚Üí Configure each workspace for optimal development
2. **Integration Testing** ‚Üí Validate real-time framework-application synchronization
3. **Workspace Documentation** ‚Üí Document workspace usage and development procedures
4. **Development Coordination** ‚Üí Prepare workspaces for parallel development workflows
5. **Status Monitoring** ‚Üí Establish workspace status monitoring and validation

## Framework Workspace Management Process

### Workspace Structure Creation
**Target Structure**:
```
Axiom/ (main repository - coordination hub)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/                           # Main git repository
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FrameworkProtocols/             # Protocol coordination (main branch)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationProtocols/           # Protocol coordination (main branch)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ framework-workspace/            # Framework development worktree
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AxiomFramework/            # Active framework development
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FrameworkProtocols/        # Framework protocol access
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .workspace-status          # Development state tracking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ application-workspace/          # Application development worktree
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AxiomExampleApp/           # Active application development
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationProtocols/      # Application protocol access
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AxiomFramework-dev@        # Symlink to framework-workspace/AxiomFramework
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .workspace-status          # Development state tracking
```

### Workspace Integration Strategy
- **Framework Workspace** ‚Üí Permanent framework branch, complete framework development context
- **Application Workspace** ‚Üí Permanent application branch, real-time framework access via symlink
- **Protocol Access** ‚Üí Each workspace has access to relevant protocols
- **Real-time Sync** ‚Üí Framework changes immediately available to application development

## Framework Workspace Command Execution

**Command**: `@WORKSPACE [setup|reset|status|cleanup]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive workspace management workflow with development environment preparation

### üîÑ **Workspace Setup Process**

**CRITICAL**: WORKSPACE commands manage git worktree infrastructure

```bash
# Workspace management execution
echo "üèóÔ∏è Framework Workspace Management"
echo "üìç Repository: $(pwd)"
echo "üåø Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"

# Validate repository state
if [ ! -d ".git" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Must be run from git repository root"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Automated Workspace Setup Process**:
1. **Repository Validation** ‚Üí Ensure execution from git repository root
2. **Existing Worktree Cleanup** ‚Üí Remove any existing development worktrees
3. **Branch Preparation** ‚Üí Ensure framework and application branches exist
4. **Framework Worktree Creation** ‚Üí Create framework-workspace/ with framework branch
5. **Application Worktree Creation** ‚Üí Create application-workspace/ with application branch
6. **Real-time Integration Setup** ‚Üí Create symlinks for framework-application connection
7. **Environment Validation** ‚Üí Verify worktree functionality and development capabilities
8. **Development Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare workspaces for immediate development use
**Git Operations**: WORKSPACE commands create and manage worktree infrastructure

```bash
# Workspace setup implementation
echo "üßπ Cleaning existing worktrees..."
git worktree remove framework-workspace 2>/dev/null || true
git worktree remove application-workspace 2>/dev/null || true

echo "üèóÔ∏è Creating framework development workspace..."
git worktree add framework-workspace framework || {
    echo "üìù Creating framework branch..."
    git checkout -b framework

    git checkout -b application
    git push origin application
    git worktree add application-workspace application
}

echo "üîó Setting up real-time framework integration..."
cd application-workspace/
ln -sf ../framework-workspace/AxiomFramework AxiomFramework-dev
cd ..

echo "üìä Creating workspace status tracking..."
echo "Framework workspace created: $(date)" > framework-workspace/.workspace-status
echo "Application workspace created: $(date)" > application-workspace/.workspace-status

echo "‚úÖ Development workspaces ready for parallel development"
echo "üìç Framework workspace: framework-workspace/"
echo "üìç Application workspace: application-workspace/"
echo "üîó Real-time integration: application-workspace/AxiomFramework-dev ‚Üí framework-workspace/AxiomFramework"
```
