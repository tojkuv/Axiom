# Protocol Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### Shared RFC Format
- Created `RFC_FORMAT.md` to eliminate duplication
- Both PLAN and DEVELOP now reference this shared format
- Ensures consistency in RFC structure across protocols

### PLAN.md Improvements
- **Focus**: Pure requirements engineering and RFC lifecycle
- **Boundaries**: Never touches code or implementation
- **Suggest Mode**: 
  - Mandatory format compliance checks
  - Mandatory duplication detection
  - Mandatory refactoring recommendations
  - Categorized by requirements stability, not implementation
- **Priority System**: 
  - High: Requirements blocking implementation
  - Medium: Requirements for feature completeness
  - Low: Requirements quality improvements

### DEVELOP.md Improvements
- **Focus**: Pure implementation via TDD
- **Boundaries**: Reads requirements, never modifies them
- **Simplified**: Removed duplicate TDD/refactoring content
- **Streamlined**: Concise command descriptions
- **Clear Role**: Transform requirements into tested code

### Key Principles Established

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - PLAN: WHAT to build (requirements)
   - DEVELOP: HOW to build (implementation)

2. **Quality Gates**:
   - PLAN: Suggestions stop when RFC is implementable
   - DEVELOP: Implementation stops when all tests pass

3. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Clear handoff points between protocols
   - No overlap in responsibilities
   - Git operations isolated to @CHECKPOINT

### Result
- Both protocols are now focused and consistent
- Duplication eliminated through shared resources
- Clear boundaries prevent scope creep
- Mandatory quality checks ensure RFC stability
