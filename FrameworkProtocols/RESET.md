# @RESET.md - Axiom Framework Development Reset Command

Framework development reset command that creates fresh development environment for framework implementation

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@RESET [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute framework development reset workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@RESET`** ‚Üí Reset framework development environment and create fresh framework branch
- **`@RESET clean`** ‚Üí Clean reset with complete framework branch deletion and recreation
- **`@RESET fresh`** ‚Üí Fresh framework development start with clean environment
- **`@RESET restart`** ‚Üí Restart framework development cycle with fresh branch

### Framework Reset Scope
**Reset Focus**: Framework development environment reset and fresh branch creation
**Branch Management**: Complete framework branch cleanup and fresh branch creation
**Environment Reset**: Clean development environment for framework implementation
**Development Integration**: Prepares clean environment for FrameworkProtocols/PLAN.md and DEVELOP.md workflows

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: RESET commands perform git operations for branch management only
**Version Control**: RESET handles branch reset operations, @CHECKPOINT handles development commits
**Work Philosophy**: RESET creates clean environment ‚Üí PLAN/DEVELOP/REFACTOR cycles ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT commits

Reset workflow operations:
1. **Environment Analysis**: Assess current framework development state
2. **Branch Cleanup**: Delete existing framework branch and clean environment
3. **Fresh Branch Creation**: Create clean framework branch for new development cycle
4. **Environment Preparation**: Prepare clean framework development environment
5. **Reset Coordination**: Update framework development tracking and coordination
**Git Operations**: RESET commands handle branch cleanup and fresh branch creation only

## Framework Development Reset Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Framework reset creates clean development environments that eliminate development conflicts, provide fresh starting points, and ensure clean framework development cycles.

**Reset Purpose**: Framework reset provides clean development environment initialization for framework development teams working on complex architectural changes.

**Environment Standards**: Framework reset ensures clean development environments with proper branch isolation, eliminated development conflicts, and fresh framework development foundation.

**Technical Focus Only**: Reset operations focus exclusively on technical environment preparation. No consideration of non-technical aspects (business strategy, adoption planning, community coordination, etc.)

## Framework Reset Methodology

### Phase 1: Framework Environment Analysis
1. **Current State Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze current framework development environment and branch state
2. **Branch State Analysis** ‚Üí Assess existing framework branch state and development conflicts
3. **Development Context Review** ‚Üí Understand current framework development context and requirements
4. **Reset Requirements Analysis** ‚Üí Understand reset scope and clean environment requirements
5. **Environment Planning** ‚Üí Plan clean framework development environment setup

### Phase 2: Framework Environment Reset
1. **Branch Cleanup** ‚Üí Delete existing framework branch and clean development state
2. **Environment Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare clean framework development environment
3. **Fresh Branch Creation** ‚Üí Create fresh framework branch for clean development cycle
4. **Development Setup** ‚Üí Setup clean framework development environment and tools
5. **Reset Validation** ‚Üí Validate clean framework development environment setup

### Phase 3: Framework Reset Documentation
1. **Reset Documentation** ‚Üí Document framework reset operation and clean environment setup
2. **Development Coordination** ‚Üí Coordinate framework reset with development team workflows
3. **Environment Status** ‚Üí Update framework development environment status and coordination
4. **Reset Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare clean framework development environment for development workflows
5. **Integration Readiness** ‚Üí Ensure clean environment integration with FrameworkProtocols workflows

## Framework Reset Process

### Framework Environment Reset
**Focus**: Clean framework development environment creation and branch management
**Scope**: Framework branch cleanup, fresh branch creation, development environment reset
**Integration**: Seamless integration with FrameworkProtocols/PLAN.md and DEVELOP.md workflows
**Coordination**: Framework reset coordination with development team workflows

### Framework Reset Benefits
- **Clean Environment**: Eliminates development conflicts and provides fresh framework development foundation
- **Branch Isolation**: Creates isolated framework development environment for complex architectural changes
- **Development Velocity**: Accelerates framework development through clean environment initialization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolves framework development conflicts through complete environment reset
- **Team Coordination**: Enables coordinated framework development with clean environment synchronization

## Framework Reset Command Execution

**Command**: `@RESET [clean|fresh|restart]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive framework development reset workflow with fresh environment creation

### üîÑ **Reset Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: RESET commands handle branch management operations for clean environment creation

```bash
# Framework environment analysis
echo "üîç Analyzing current framework development environment..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "üìç Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Framework branch cleanup
echo "üßπ Framework environment cleanup..."
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "framework" ]; then
    echo "üîÑ Switching from framework branch to main..."
    git checkout main
fi

# Delete existing framework branch
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/framework; then
    echo "üóëÔ∏è Deleting existing framework branch..."
    git branch -D framework 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "‚úÖ Local framework branch deleted"
fi

# Delete remote framework branch
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/framework; then
    echo "üóëÔ∏è Deleting remote framework branch..."
    git push origin --delete framework 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "‚úÖ Remote framework branch deleted"
fi

# Create fresh framework branch
echo "üå± Creating fresh framework branch..."
git checkout -b framework
echo "‚úÖ Fresh framework branch created and active"

# Framework reset validation
echo "üîç Validating framework reset environment..."
echo "üìç Active branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "‚úÖ Framework development environment reset complete"
```

**Automated Reset Execution Process**:
1. **Environment Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze current framework development state and branch configuration
2. **Branch Cleanup** ‚Üí Delete existing framework branch (local and remote) for clean environment
3. **Fresh Branch Creation** ‚Üí Create clean framework branch for new development cycle
4. **Environment Validation** ‚Üí Validate clean framework development environment setup
5. **Reset Coordination** ‚Üí Update framework development coordination and team synchronization
6. **Integration Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare clean environment for FrameworkProtocols workflow integration
**Git Operations**: RESET commands handle branch cleanup and fresh branch creation only
