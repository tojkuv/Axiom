# @PLAN.md - Axiom Framework Development Planning Command

Framework development planning command that creates proposals for framework implementation

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@PLAN [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute framework development planning workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@PLAN`** ‚Üí Create framework development proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Active/
- **`@PLAN plan`** ‚Üí Plan framework development tasks and create proposal
- **`@PLAN analyze`** ‚Üí Analyze framework needs and create implementation proposal
- **`@PLAN enhance`** ‚Üí Plan framework enhancements and capability improvements

### Framework Planning Scope
**Planning Focus**: Framework development proposal creation and strategic planning
**Branch Requirement**: Must be executed from framework branch for framework development
**Proposal Creation**: Creates structured framework proposals for user review and revision
**Development Integration**: Proposals are implemented through FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md after user approval

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: PLAN commands NEVER perform git operations (commit/push/merge)
**Version Control**: Only @CHECKPOINT commands handle all git operations
**Work Philosophy**: PLAN creates proposals ‚Üí Multiple PLAN/DEVELOP/REFACTOR cycles ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT commits and merges

Work commands operate on current branch without version control:
1. **Analysis**: Read current TRACKING.md priorities and framework status
2. **Planning**: Create framework development proposals
3. **Proposal Management**: Move proposals through lifecycle stages
4. **Documentation**: Update proposal status and planning coordination
**No Git Operations**: PLAN commands never commit, push, or merge

## Framework Development Planning Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Framework planning creates detailed technical proposals for framework development that can be reviewed, revised, and approved by users before implementation begins. Proposals focus exclusively on technical implementation details.

**Proposal Workflow**: @PLAN creates framework proposals ‚Üí User reviews/revises ‚Üí FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md implements ‚Üí Progress tracked in FrameworkProtocols/TRACKING.md

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **PLAN**: Reads TRACKING.md priorities ‚Üí Creates proposals ‚Üí NO implementation
- **DEVELOP**: Implements proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md progress ‚Üí NO planning
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md completion ‚Üí NO development
- **REFACTOR**: Code organization ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md quality ‚Üí NO functionality changes
- **TRACKING**: Central progress store ‚Üí Updated by all commands ‚Üí NO command execution

**Quality Standards**: Framework proposals include comprehensive technical specifications, implementation approaches, and success criteria

**Technical Focus Only**: Proposals strictly focus on technical implementation details. No consideration of non-technical aspects (community involvement, adoption, marketing, business strategy, user engagement, etc.)

## Framework Planning Methodology

### Phase 1: Framework Analysis
1. **TRACKING.md Review** ‚Üí Read current priorities, progress, and next actions from FrameworkProtocols/TRACKING.md
2. **Current Framework Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze current framework implementation status and needs
3. **Technical Requirements Analysis** ‚Üí Understand technical objectives and implementation constraints only
4. **Technical Assessment** ‚Üí Evaluate framework technical approaches and implementation strategies
5. **Technical Architecture Planning** ‚Üí Assess technical framework architecture changes and implementation requirements
6. **Technical Success Criteria Definition** ‚Üí Define measurable technical outcomes and validation criteria (performance, functionality, architecture compliance)

### Phase 2: Framework Proposal Creation
1. **Technical Specification** ‚Üí Create detailed framework technical approach and architecture
2. **Implementation Planning** ‚Üí Plan framework development phases and implementation steps
3. **Testing Strategy** ‚Üí Define framework testing approach and validation procedures
4. **Documentation Planning** ‚Üí Plan framework documentation updates and requirements
5. **Integration Strategy** ‚Üí Define integration with existing framework codebase and workflows

### Phase 3: Framework Proposal Documentation
1. **Structured Format** ‚Üí Create framework proposal using established format and sections
2. **Technical Details** ‚Üí Include comprehensive framework technical specifications and approaches
3. **Implementation Roadmap** ‚Üí Provide clear framework implementation steps and phases
4. **Success Metrics** ‚Üí Define measurable framework success criteria and validation approaches
5. **Review Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare framework proposal for user review and potential revision

## Framework Proposal Creation Process

### Framework Proposals (AxiomFramework/Proposals/)
**Focus**: Core framework development, architecture enhancements, capability implementation
**Directories**: 
- Active/: Framework proposals under development
- WaitingApproval/: Framework proposals ready for user review
- Archive/: Completed framework proposals
**Implementation**: Implemented through FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md
**Progress Tracking**: Tracked in FrameworkProtocols/TRACKING.md

## Framework Proposal Lifecycle Management

### Framework Proposal States
- **Active**: Framework proposal created in Active/ directory, under development
- **Waiting Approval**: Framework proposal moved to WaitingApproval/ directory, ready for user review
- **Under Revision**: User requests changes, framework proposal updated in Active/ directory
- **Approved**: User approves framework proposal, ready for FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md implementation
- **In Development**: FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md implementing proposal, progress tracked in TRACKING.md
- **Completed**: Framework implementation complete, proposal archived to Archive/ directory

### Framework Workflow Integration
1. **FrameworkProtocols/@PLAN** ‚Üí Creates framework proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Active/
2. **Proposal Completion** ‚Üí Framework proposal moved to AxiomFramework/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
3. **User Review** ‚Üí User reviews and optionally revises framework proposal
4. **User Approval** ‚Üí User approves framework proposal for implementation
5. **FrameworkProtocols/@DEVELOP** ‚Üí Implements framework proposal, tracks progress in TRACKING.md
6. **FrameworkProtocols/@CHECKPOINT** ‚Üí Completes framework implementation, archives proposal

## Framework Planning Command Execution

**Command**: `@PLAN [plan|analyze|enhance]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive framework planning workflow with proposal creation

### üîÑ **Planning Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: PLAN commands work on current branch state - NO git operations

```bash
# Branch switching - Create fresh framework branch before starting work
echo "üîÑ Creating fresh framework branch..."
ORIGINAL_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "üìç Current branch: $ORIGINAL_BRANCH"

# Delete existing framework branch if it exists
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/framework; then
    echo "üóëÔ∏è Deleting existing framework branch..."
    if [ "$ORIGINAL_BRANCH" = "framework" ]; then
        git checkout main
    fi
    git branch -D framework 2>/dev/null || true
    git push origin --delete framework 2>/dev/null || true
fi

# Create fresh framework branch
echo "üå± Creating fresh framework branch..."
git checkout -b framework
echo "‚úÖ Fresh framework branch created and active"

# Planning workflow (NO git operations)
echo "üéØ Framework Planning Execution"
echo "üìç Working on current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Version control managed by @CHECKPOINT only"
echo "üéØ Planning ready - proceeding on framework branch"
```

**Automated Execution Process**:
1. **TRACKING.md Priority Analysis** ‚Üí Read current priorities and status from FrameworkProtocols/TRACKING.md
2. **Framework Context Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze existing framework implementation and identify development needs
3. **Requirements Assessment** ‚Üí Understand framework development objectives and constraints
4. **Technical Planning** ‚Üí Design framework technical approach and implementation strategy
5. **Framework Proposal Creation** ‚Üí Create structured framework proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Active/
6. **Review Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare framework proposal for user review and potential revision
**No Git Operations**: All version control handled by @CHECKPOINT commands only
**Branch Management**: Work remains on framework branch for @CHECKPOINT integration

**Framework Planning Execution Examples**:
- `@PLAN` ‚Üí Create framework development proposal
- `@PLAN plan` ‚Üí Plan framework development tasks and create proposal
- `@PLAN analyze` ‚Üí Analyze framework needs and create implementation proposal
- `@PLAN enhance` ‚Üí Plan framework enhancements and capability improvements
