# @PLAN.md - Axiom Framework Proposal Lifecycle Management

Framework proposal lifecycle management command that creates, approves, and resolves proposals

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@PLAN [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute framework proposal lifecycle workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@PLAN`** ‚Üí Show current proposal status across all directories
- **`@PLAN create`** ‚Üí Create new proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Unapproved/
- **`@PLAN approve`** ‚Üí Move proposal from Unapproved/ to Approved/ and update TRACKING.md
- **`@PLAN resolve`** ‚Üí Archive completed proposal from Approved/ to Archive/
- **`@PLAN status`** ‚Üí Display detailed proposal status in each lifecycle stage

### Framework Planning Scope
**Lifecycle Management**: Complete proposal lifecycle from creation to resolution
**Branch Requirement**: Must be executed from framework branch for framework development
**Proposal Management**: Creates, approves, and resolves framework proposals
**Development Integration**: Approved proposals implemented through FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: PLAN commands NEVER perform git operations (commit/push/merge)
**Version Control**: Only @CHECKPOINT commands handle all git operations
**Work Philosophy**: PLAN manages full lifecycle ‚Üí Creates proposals ‚Üí Approves proposals ‚Üí DEVELOP implements ‚Üí PLAN resolves completed work ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT commits and merges

Work commands operate on current branch without version control:
1. **Creation**: Create new proposals directly in Unapproved/
2. **Approval**: Move proposals to Approved/ and update TRACKING.md priorities
3. **Resolution**: Archive completed proposals from Approved/ to Archive/
4. **Status Tracking**: Update TRACKING.md at approval and resolution stages
**No Git Operations**: PLAN commands never commit, push, or merge

## Framework Development Planning Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Framework planning manages the complete lifecycle of technical proposals - from creation through approval to resolution. This protocol handles proposal workflow management, not framework architecture decisions.

**Proposal Workflow**: @PLAN create (Unapproved/) ‚Üí User reviews ‚Üí @PLAN approve (to Approved/) ‚Üí DEVELOP implements ‚Üí @PLAN resolve (to Archive/)

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **PLAN**: Manages complete proposal lifecycle (create/approve/resolve) ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md
- **DEVELOP**: Implements approved proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md progress ‚Üí NO planning
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md completion ‚Üí NO development
- **REFACTOR**: Code organization ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md quality ‚Üí NO functionality changes
- **DOCUMENT**: Documentation operations ‚Üí NO implementation or planning
- **TRACKING**: Central progress store ‚Üí Updated by all commands ‚Üí NO command execution

**Quality Standards**: Framework proposals include comprehensive technical specifications, clear implementation paths, and measurable success criteria

**Technical Focus Only**: Proposals strictly focus on technical implementation for AI agent coding. Framework design prioritizes machine readability, consistent patterns, and deterministic behavior optimized for automated development workflows.

## Framework Planning Methodology

### Phase 1: Framework Analysis
1. **TRACKING.md Review** ‚Üí Read current priorities and progress
2. **Framework Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze current implementation state
3. **Requirements Analysis** ‚Üí Identify development needs and gaps
4. **Technical Planning** ‚Üí Define implementation approach
5. **Resource Planning** ‚Üí Estimate development effort
6. **Risk Assessment** ‚Üí Identify potential challenges

### Phase 2: Framework Proposal Creation
1. **Technical Specification** ‚Üí Define implementation approach and architecture
2. **Type Safety Design** ‚Üí Plan compile-time validation and guarantees
3. **Concurrency Strategy** ‚Üí Design actor-based isolation patterns
4. **Performance Targets** ‚Üí Set measurable optimization goals
5. **Code Generation** ‚Üí Plan boilerplate reduction strategies
6. **Testing Approach** ‚Üí Define comprehensive validation procedures
7. **Integration Planning** ‚Üí Ensure compatibility with existing framework

### Phase 3: Framework Proposal Finalization
1. **Structured Format** ‚Üí Create framework proposal using established format and sections
2. **Technical Details** ‚Üí Include comprehensive framework technical specifications and approaches
3. **Implementation Roadmap** ‚Üí Provide clear framework implementation steps and phases
4. **Success Metrics** ‚Üí Define measurable framework success criteria and validation approaches
5. **Ready for Review** ‚Üí Save proposal in Unapproved/ for user review

## Framework Proposal Creation Process

### Framework Proposals (AxiomFramework/Proposals/)
**Focus**: Core framework development, architecture enhancements, capability implementation
**Directories**: 
- Unapproved/: New proposals awaiting approval
- Approved/: Approved proposals ready for development
- Archive/: Completed proposals
**Implementation**: Implemented through FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md
**Progress Tracking**: Updated in TRACKING.md at approval and resolution

## Framework Proposal Lifecycle Management

### Framework Proposal States
- **Unapproved**: New proposal in Unapproved/ directory awaiting review
- **Under Review**: User reviewing proposal in Unapproved/
- **Approved**: Proposal moved to Approved/, TRACKING.md updated with priorities
- **In Development**: @DEVELOP implementing from Approved/ directory
- **Completed**: Implementation done, ready for resolution
- **Archived**: @PLAN resolve moves from Approved/ to Archive/

### Framework Workflow Integration
1. **@PLAN create** ‚Üí Creates proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Unapproved/
2. **User Review** ‚Üí User reviews proposal in Unapproved/
3. **@PLAN approve** ‚Üí Move to Approved/, update TRACKING.md priorities
4. **@DEVELOP** ‚Üí Implement from Approved/ with progress tracking
5. **@PLAN resolve** ‚Üí Archive from Approved/ to Archive/, update TRACKING.md
6. **@CHECKPOINT** ‚Üí Commit completed work to version control

## Framework Planning Command Execution

**Command**: `@PLAN [create|approve|resolve|status]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive framework proposal lifecycle management

### üîÑ **Planning Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: PLAN commands work on current branch state - NO git operations

```bash
# Navigate to framework workspace
echo "üîÑ Entering framework development workspace..."
cd framework-workspace/ || {
    echo "‚ùå Framework workspace not found"
    echo "üí° Run '@WORKSPACE setup' to initialize worktrees"
    exit 1
}

# Planning workflow (NO git operations)
echo "üéØ Framework Planning Execution"
echo "üìç Workspace: $(pwd)"
echo "üåø Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Version control managed by @CHECKPOINT only"
echo "üéØ Planning ready - proceeding in framework workspace"
```

**Automated Execution Process**:

### Create Mode (`@PLAN create`)
1. **TRACKING.md Analysis** ‚Üí Read current priorities from FrameworkProtocols/TRACKING.md
2. **Requirements Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze framework development needs
3. **Proposal Creation** ‚Üí Create structured proposal in AxiomFramework/Proposals/Unapproved/
4. **Ready for Review** ‚Üí Proposal immediately available for user review

### Approve Mode (`@PLAN approve`)
1. **Scan Unapproved/** ‚Üí List proposals awaiting approval
2. **Validate Proposals** ‚Üí Ensure technical completeness
3. **Move to Approved/** ‚Üí Transfer proposal to Approved/ directory
4. **Update TRACKING.md** ‚Üí Add to development priorities

### Resolve Mode (`@PLAN resolve`)
1. **Scan Approved/** ‚Üí List completed proposals in Approved/
2. **Validate Completion** ‚Üí Verify implementation success
3. **Archive Proposal** ‚Üí Move from Approved/ to Archive/
4. **Update TRACKING.md** ‚Üí Mark as completed and clear from priorities

**No Git Operations**: All version control handled by @CHECKPOINT commands only
