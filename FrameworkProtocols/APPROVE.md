# @APPROVE.md - Axiom Framework Proposal Approval Command

Framework proposal approval command that accepts proposals and prepares development cycles

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@APPROVE [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute framework proposal approval workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@APPROVE`** ‚Üí Approve available framework proposals in AxiomFramework/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
- **`@APPROVE proposal`** ‚Üí Approve specific framework proposal by name
- **`@APPROVE review`** ‚Üí Review and approve framework proposals after validation
- **`@APPROVE batch`** ‚Üí Approve multiple framework proposals in sequence

### Framework Approval Scope
**Approval Focus**: Framework proposal acceptance and development cycle preparation
**Branch Independence**: Works on current branch - no git operations performed
**Proposal Processing**: Processes framework proposals from WaitingApproval/ directory
**Development Integration**: Prepares approved proposals for FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md implementation

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: APPROVE commands NEVER perform git operations (commit/push/merge)
**Version Control**: Only @CHECKPOINT commands handle all git operations
**Work Philosophy**: APPROVE accepts proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md priorities ‚Üí DEVELOP implements ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT commits

Work commands operate on current branch without version control:
1. **Proposal Analysis**: Read available proposals from AxiomFramework/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
2. **Approval Processing**: Accept proposals and prepare for implementation
3. **TRACKING.md Updates**: Update framework development priorities and next actions
4. **Development Preparation**: Prepare approved proposals for implementation workflow
**No Git Operations**: APPROVE commands never commit, push, or merge

## Framework Proposal Approval Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Framework proposal approval provides structured acceptance of completed proposals, updating development tracking to prepare for systematic implementation cycles. Approval focuses exclusively on proposal acceptance and development preparation.

**Approval Workflow**: @APPROVE processes WaitingApproval/ proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md priorities ‚Üí FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md implements ‚Üí Progress tracked through development cycle

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **APPROVE**: Accepts proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md ‚Üí NO implementation
- **PLAN**: Creates proposals ‚Üí NO approval decisions
- **DEVELOP**: Implements approved proposals ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md progress ‚Üí NO approval
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow ‚Üí Updates TRACKING.md completion ‚Üí NO approval
- **TRACKING**: Central progress store ‚Üí Updated by APPROVE and other commands ‚Üí NO command execution

**Quality Standards**: Framework proposal approval includes proposal validation, priority assignment, and systematic development preparation

**Technical Focus Only**: Approval strictly focuses on technical proposal acceptance and development preparation. No consideration of non-technical aspects (community involvement, adoption, marketing, business strategy, user engagement, etc.)

## Framework Proposal Approval Methodology

### Phase 1: Framework Proposal Analysis
1. **WaitingApproval/ Directory Scan** ‚Üí Identify available framework proposals ready for approval
2. **Proposal Validation** ‚Üí Validate proposal completeness and technical specification quality
3. **Priority Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze proposal priority and development impact
4. **Implementation Readiness** ‚Üí Assess proposal readiness for development implementation
5. **Dependency Analysis** ‚Üí Understand proposal dependencies and implementation order
6. **Resource Assessment** ‚Üí Evaluate development resource requirements and timeline

### Phase 2: Framework Proposal Approval
1. **Proposal Acceptance** ‚Üí Accept framework proposals for implementation
2. **Priority Assignment** ‚Üí Assign implementation priorities based on proposal analysis
3. **TRACKING.md Integration** ‚Üí Update framework development tracking with approved proposals
4. **Development Planning** ‚Üí Prepare approved proposals for development cycle execution
5. **Implementation Coordination** ‚Üí Coordinate proposal implementation with development workflow

### Phase 3: Framework Development Preparation
1. **Development Cycle Setup** ‚Üí Prepare framework development cycle for approved proposals
2. **Progress Tracking Integration** ‚Üí Integrate approved proposals into tracking system
3. **Implementation Roadmap** ‚Üí Create implementation roadmap for development execution
4. **Quality Gate Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare quality validation for proposal implementation
5. **Coordination Updates** ‚Üí Update development coordination for approved proposals

## Framework Proposal Approval Process

### Framework Proposals Processing (AxiomFramework/Proposals/)
**Source Directory**: WaitingApproval/ ‚Üí Framework proposals ready for approval
**Target Integration**: TRACKING.md ‚Üí Development priority and progress tracking
**Implementation Flow**: Approved proposals ‚Üí FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md execution
**Archive Management**: Completed proposals ‚Üí Archive/ directory for reference

### Framework Proposal Lifecycle Management

#### Framework Proposal Approval States
- **WaitingApproval**: Framework proposals ready for approval review
- **Under Review**: Proposals being analyzed for approval decision
- **Approved**: Proposals accepted and integrated into development tracking
- **In Development Queue**: Approved proposals prepared for implementation
- **Development Ready**: Proposals ready for FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md execution

#### Framework Approval Workflow Integration
1. **FrameworkProtocols/@APPROVE** ‚Üí Processes framework proposals from AxiomFramework/Proposals/WaitingApproval/
2. **Proposal Validation** ‚Üí Validates proposal quality and implementation readiness
3. **TRACKING.md Updates** ‚Üí Updates FrameworkProtocols/TRACKING.md with approved proposal priorities
4. **Development Preparation** ‚Üí Prepares approved proposals for development cycle execution
5. **FrameworkProtocols/@DEVELOP** ‚Üí Implements approved proposals using updated tracking priorities
6. **FrameworkProtocols/@CHECKPOINT** ‚Üí Completes implementation and archives completed proposals

## Framework Approval Command Execution

**Command**: `@APPROVE [proposal|review|batch]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive framework proposal approval workflow with development preparation

### üîÑ **Approval Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: APPROVE commands work on current branch state - NO git operations

```bash
# Navigate to framework workspace
echo "üîÑ Entering framework development workspace..."
cd framework-workspace/ || {
    echo "‚ùå Framework workspace not found"
    echo "üí° Run '@WORKSPACE setup' to initialize worktrees"
    exit 1
}

# Approval workflow (NO git operations)
echo "‚úÖ Framework Proposal Approval Execution"
echo "üìç Workspace: $(pwd)"
echo "üåø Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Version control managed by @CHECKPOINT only"
echo "‚úÖ Approval ready - proceeding in framework workspace"
```

**Automated Approval Process**:
1. **WaitingApproval/ Analysis** ‚Üí Scan AxiomFramework/Proposals/WaitingApproval/ for available proposals
2. **Proposal Validation** ‚Üí Validate proposal completeness and technical specification quality
3. **Priority Assessment** ‚Üí Analyze proposal priorities and implementation dependencies
4. **Approval Processing** ‚Üí Accept proposals for development implementation
5. **TRACKING.md Updates** ‚Üí Update FrameworkProtocols/TRACKING.md with approved proposal priorities
6. **Development Preparation** ‚Üí Prepare approved proposals for development cycle execution
7. **Implementation Coordination** ‚Üí Coordinate proposal implementation with development workflow
**No Git Operations**: All version control handled by @CHECKPOINT commands only


**Framework Approval Execution Examples**:
- `@APPROVE` ‚Üí Approve available framework proposals and update development tracking
- `@APPROVE proposal` ‚Üí Approve specific framework proposal by name
- `@APPROVE review` ‚Üí Review and approve framework proposals after validation
- `@APPROVE batch` ‚Üí Approve multiple framework proposals in sequence
