# @REVIEW Protocol

**Purpose**: Systematic evaluation of active proposal implementation progress with evidence-based validation

## Protocol Execution

### 1. Proposal Status Assessment

**Active Proposals Analysis**
- Enumerate all proposals in `AxiomFramework/Proposals/Active/`
- Extract implementation status, priority, and timeline data
- Identify phase completion status and deliverable verification
- Assess technical specification adherence

**Progress Measurement Criteria**
- Phase deliverable completion percentage
- Success criteria achievement validation
- Technical architecture compliance verification
- Integration requirement satisfaction assessment

### 2. Implementation Evidence Collection

**Code Implementation Verification**
- Source code analysis for specified deliverables
- Test coverage measurement against proposal targets
- Performance benchmark execution and validation
- API implementation completeness assessment

**Documentation Validation**
- Technical specification implementation alignment
- Architecture constraint compliance verification
- Integration note requirements satisfaction
- Success criteria measurable achievement

### 3. Risk Assessment Analysis

**Implementation Deviation Detection**
- Timeline variance measurement and impact analysis
- Technical requirement gap identification
- Resource allocation efficiency assessment
- Quality standard compliance validation

**Mitigation Strategy Evaluation**
- Risk response effectiveness measurement
- Alternative approach requirement assessment
- Implementation adjustment recommendation generation
- Quality gate satisfaction verification

### 4. Progress Documentation

**Implementation Status Report**
- Current phase completion percentage with evidence
- Deliverable completion status with verification
- Performance metric achievement against targets
- Technical debt accumulation assessment

**Recommendation Generation**
- Priority adjustment recommendations based on evidence
- Resource reallocation strategies for optimization
- Risk mitigation approach refinement suggestions
- Timeline adjustment rationale with supporting data

## Execution Framework

### Evidence Collection Protocol

```markdown
## Proposal: [PROPOSAL_NAME]
**Status**: [APPROVED|IN_PROGRESS|BLOCKED|COMPLETED]
**Priority**: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
**Implementation Phase**: [N of TOTAL]

### Phase Progress Assessment
- **Current Phase**: [Phase Description]
- **Completion**: [XX%] with [evidence sources]
- **Deliverables**: [N completed / TOTAL] with verification
- **Timeline Variance**: [Â±XX hours] from planned [XX hours]

### Technical Implementation Validation
- **Code Coverage**: [XX%] against [target %]
- **Test Coverage**: [XX%] against [target %]
- **Performance**: [metrics] against [targets]
- **Architecture Compliance**: [PASS|FAIL] with [evidence]

### Risk Status
- **Current Risks**: [identified risks with impact assessment]
- **Mitigation Effectiveness**: [measured outcomes]
- **Adjustment Requirements**: [recommended changes]
```

### Validation Methodology

**Quantitative Assessment**
- Measurement of deliverable completion against proposal specifications
- Performance metric validation against established targets
- Test coverage analysis with gap identification
- Code quality metric evaluation with threshold validation

**Qualitative Evaluation**
- Technical architecture adherence assessment
- Integration requirement satisfaction verification
- Developer experience impact measurement
- Framework stability preservation validation

## Protocol Integration

### Workflow Coordination
- **DEVELOP.md Integration**: Implementation progress feeds development priorities
- **CHECKPOINT.md Alignment**: Review findings inform version control decisions
- **TRACKING.md Updates**: Progress data updates framework development tracking

### Decision Authority
- **Continue Implementation**: Evidence supports continued development
- **Adjust Approach**: Data indicates implementation strategy modification required
- **Escalate Issues**: Critical gaps or risks require intervention
- **Archive Proposal**: Implementation completion verified with success criteria met

## Execution Schedule

**Review Frequency**: Execute before CHECKPOINT.md protocol execution
**Progress Validation**: After each major phase completion
**Risk Assessment**: Weekly during active implementation periods
**Final Validation**: Upon proposal completion claim verification

---

**Protocol Objective**: Maintain implementation quality and timeline adherence through systematic progress evaluation with evidence-based validation and data-driven decision making
