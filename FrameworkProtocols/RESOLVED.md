# RESOLVED Protocol

## Purpose
Complete development cycle for approved proposals, archive implementation, update tracking

## Scope  
Framework proposal resolution, completion documentation, progress archival

## Protocol Execution

### 1. Proposal Completion Validation
- Verify all critical phases completed successfully
- Confirm success criteria achieved  
- Document implementation outcomes
- Validate framework stability

### 2. TRACKING.md Update
- Mark current proposal as RESOLVED
- Archive proposal details to completed section
- Update framework status with achievements
- Reset for next development cycle

### 3. Proposal Archival
- Move completed proposal to archive location
- Preserve implementation documentation
- Maintain development history
- Clear active proposal tracking

### 4. Cycle Completion
- Execute standardized git workflow
- Commit resolution documentation
- Merge framework improvements to main
- Prepare for next development cycle

## Current Proposal Resolution
