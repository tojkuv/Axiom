# @EXPLORE.md - Axiom Framework Exploration Command

Framework exploration command that analyzes type-safe, concurrency-safe, performant, deterministic, actor-based framework components

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@EXPLORE [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute framework exploration workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@EXPLORE`** ‚Üí Explore current framework context and provide comprehensive analysis
- **`@EXPLORE analyze`** ‚Üí Deep analysis of specific framework components or architecture
- **`@EXPLORE explain`** ‚Üí Explain framework concepts, patterns, and implementation details
- **`@EXPLORE reason`** ‚Üí Reason about framework design decisions and architectural choices
- **`@EXPLORE validate`** ‚Üí Explore and validate framework implementation against design constraints

### Framework Exploration Scope
**Exploration Focus**: Framework component analysis, architectural reasoning, implementation explanation
**Branch Independence**: Works on current branch - no git operations performed
**Analysis Creation**: Provides detailed framework analysis and explanations for user understanding
**Knowledge Integration**: Integrates with framework documentation and implementation patterns

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Architecture**
**IMPORTANT**: EXPLORE commands NEVER perform git operations (commit/push/merge)
**Version Control**: Only @CHECKPOINT commands handle all git operations
**Work Philosophy**: EXPLORE analyzes and explains ‚Üí Understanding gained ‚Üí Other workflows implement changes

Work commands operate on current branch without version control:
1. **Analysis**: Read framework components and architectural implementation
2. **Exploration**: Deep dive into framework patterns and design decisions
3. **Explanation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of framework behavior
4. **Reasoning**: Analyze architectural choices and constraint compliance
**No Git Operations**: EXPLORE commands never commit, push, or merge

## Framework Exploration Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Framework exploration provides deep analysis of type-safe, concurrency-safe, performant, deterministic framework components. Focuses on actor-based patterns, capabilities permissions, minimal boilerplate design, and consistent patterns optimized for AI agent coding.

**Exploration Workflow**: @EXPLORE analyzes framework components ‚Üí Provides detailed explanations ‚Üí Supports informed development decisions ‚Üí Knowledge documented for team understanding

### üéØ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **EXPLORE**: Analyzes and explains framework components ‚Üí NO implementation changes
- **PLAN**: Creates proposals based on exploration insights ‚Üí NO direct analysis
- **DEVELOP**: Implements based on understanding ‚Üí NO exploratory analysis
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow ‚Üí NO exploration or analysis
- **TRACKING**: Progress tracking ‚Üí NO component analysis

**Quality Standards**: Framework exploration provides comprehensive technical analysis, architectural reasoning, and implementation explanations

**Technical Focus Only**: Exploration strictly focuses on technical analysis and understanding. No consideration of non-technical aspects (community involvement, adoption, marketing, business strategy, user engagement, etc.)

## Framework Exploration Command Execution

**Command**: `@EXPLORE [analyze|explain|reason|validate]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive framework exploration workflow with detailed analysis

### üîÑ **Exploration Execution Process**

**CRITICAL**: EXPLORE commands work on current branch state - NO git operations

```bash
# Navigate to framework workspace
echo "üîÑ Entering framework development workspace..."
cd framework-workspace/ || {
    echo "‚ùå Framework workspace not found"
    echo "üí° Run '@WORKSPACE setup' to initialize worktrees"
    exit 1
}

# Exploration workflow (NO git operations)
echo "üîç Framework Exploration Execution"
echo "üìç Workspace: $(pwd)"
echo "üåø Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Version control managed by @CHECKPOINT only"
echo "üîç Exploration ready - proceeding in framework workspace"
```

**Automated Exploration Process**:
1. **Framework Context Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze current framework implementation and component state
2. **Component Deep Dive** ‚Üí Examine specific framework components and their implementation
3. **Architecture Analysis** ‚Üí Analyze framework architecture and constraint compliance
4. **Pattern Assessment** ‚Üí Identify and analyze implementation patterns and conventions
5. **Design Reasoning** ‚Üí Analyze architectural decisions and design trade-offs
6. **Implementation Explanation** ‚Üí Provide detailed explanations of framework behavior
7. **Knowledge Synthesis** ‚Üí Synthesize analysis findings into comprehensive understanding
**No Git Operations**: All version control handled by @CHECKPOINT commands only
