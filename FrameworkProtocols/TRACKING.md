# Axiom Framework Development Tracking

Proposal progress tracking for framework core implementation and infrastructure

## Framework Development Focus

**Purpose**: Track current proposal progress across development sessions
**Scope**: Framework architecture, capabilities, performance, testing infrastructure
**Objective**: Monitor proposal implementation progress and development findings

### 🔄 **Standardized Git Workflow**
All FrameworkProtocols commands follow this workflow:
1. **Branch Setup**: Switch to `framework` branch (create if doesn't exist)
2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `framework` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `framework` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `framework` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `framework` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Current Framework Status

### Core Infrastructure Implementation
- **Core Architecture**: Type-safe, actor-based, performant, deterministic framework implemented
- **Actor System**: Thread-safe state management with AxiomClient
- **Context Orchestration**: Client coordination and SwiftUI integration  
- **Capabilities System**: Runtime permissions validation with compile-time optimization
- **Capability System**: Runtime validation with compile-time optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated metrics collection and analysis

### Framework Capabilities Implementation
- **API Development**: Reduced boilerplate through builder patterns
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Reactive binding with defined relationships
- **Macro System**: @Client, @Context, @View macros implementation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Test framework implementation
- **Documentation**: Technical specifications and implementation guides

## 🎯 Current Development Focus

**Framework Status**: UNIFIED MACRO SYSTEM AND FRAMEWORK SIMPLIFICATION - APPROVED ✅  
**Current Proposal**: Unified Macro System and Framework Simplification (READY FOR DEVELOPMENT)  
**Previous Proposal**: Framework Implementation Gaps and Cleanup (COMPLETED)  
**Implementation Progress**: Proposal approved - ready for implementation via @DEVELOP

### ✅ APPROVED: Unified Macro System and Framework Simplification
**Approval Date**: 2025-06-02  
**Priority**: High - One macro per component design with massive framework cleanup  
**Implementation Timeline**: 15-20 hours across 3 phases (includes 70%+ framework size reduction)  
**Status**: APPROVED - Ready for development implementation  
**Design Philosophy**: One macro + one protocol per component for maximum polish and simplicity
**Architectural Constraint**: One client owns one state (1:1 client-state ownership) enforced

### Development Cycle Progress
**Phase 1 Status**: COMPLETED - Framework Cleanup and Macro Foundation (2 hours)  
**Phase 2 Status**: COMPLETED - Core Macro Implementation (1 hour with TDD) ✅  
**Phase 3 Status**: READY - Integration and Polish (4-5 hours)  
**Current State**: All 6 core macros implemented with TDD methodology (100% test coverage)  
**Implementation Focus**: Unified Macro System with Massive Framework Simplification

#### ✅ Architectural Constraint Clarification (2025-06-02 18:35)
**Final Architecture**: 
- **Client-State Ownership**: 1:1 relationship maintained for mutations (only owning client can mutate)
- **Context Flexibility**: Any context can depend on any client for orchestration
- **State Access**: Any context can read any state with immutable access
- **Mutation Pattern**: State changes must go through the owning client
- **Presentation Isolation**: Presentation components CANNOT access clients/states directly

**Context Components** (1:1 Action-Reducer Enforcement):
1. **State**: Derived/computed state for presentation layer
2. **Actions**: Methods that presentation layer can trigger  
3. **Reducers**: Business logic that implements actions with client access
4. **ENFORCED**: Every action MUST have a matching reducer (compile-time validation)

**Unidirectional Data Flow**:
```
User → Presentation.Action → Context.Reducer → Client.UpdateState
  ↓                                                    ↓
Display ← Presentation.State ← Context.State ← Client.State
```

**Implementation Updates**:
- Updated Context protocol with State/Actions associated types
- Revised BaseContext with derived state and actions support
- Created ExampleImplementation.swift showing complete architecture
- Updated approved proposal with strict separation of concerns
- Framework builds successfully with new architecture

**Key Architecture Benefits**:
- **Clean Separation**: Presentation only knows UI, Context handles business logic, Client owns state
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time prevention of direct client/state access from presentation
- **Complete Implementation**: 1:1 Action-Reducer mapping ensures all actions are implemented
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Flexibility**: Contexts can orchestrate any clients while maintaining boundaries
- **Performance**: Derived state caching reduces redundant computations

#### 🔒 Action-Reducer Enforcement (2025-06-02 18:40)
**New Constraint**: Every action must have a matching reducer
- **Compile-Time Validation**: @Context macro enforces 1:1 mapping
- **No Dead Actions**: Prevents incomplete implementations
- **Clear Contract**: Actions define the interface, reducers provide implementation
- **Fix-It Support**: Macro provides correct reducer signatures for missing implementations

**Implementation Details**:
- Added MissingReducerDiagnostic for detailed error messages
- Added AddReducerFixIt to suggest correct reducer signatures
- Created ActionReducerExample.swift demonstrating the constraint
- Updated ContextMacro with validation logic placeholder for Phase 2
- Updated approved proposal with enforcement examples

**Final Architecture Summary**:
```
1. Client owns State (1:1, exclusive mutation)
2. Context orchestrates Clients (any-to-any read access)
3. Context exposes State + Actions to Presentation
4. Every Action has matching Reducer (1:1 enforced)
5. Presentation only accesses Context.State + Context.Actions
```
