# Axiom Framework Development Tracking

Proposal progress tracking for framework core implementation and infrastructure

## Framework Development Focus

**Purpose**: Track current proposal progress across development sessions
**Scope**: Framework architecture, capabilities, performance, testing infrastructure
**Objective**: Monitor proposal implementation progress and development findings

### 🔄 **Standardized Git Workflow**

2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `framework` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `framework` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `framework` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `framework` branch and create fresh one for next cycle
