# Axiom Framework Development Tracking

Proposal progress tracking for framework core implementation and infrastructure

## Framework Development Focus

**Purpose**: Track current proposal progress across development sessions
**Scope**: Framework architecture, capabilities, performance, testing infrastructure
**Objective**: Monitor proposal implementation progress and development findings

### ðŸ”„ **Standardized Git Workflow**
All FrameworkProtocols commands follow this workflow:
1. **Branch Setup**: Switch to `framework` branch (create if doesn't exist)
2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `framework` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `framework` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `framework` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `framework` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Current Framework Status

### Core Infrastructure Implementation
- **Architectural Constraints**: 8 architectural constraints implemented
- **Actor System**: Thread-safe state management with AxiomClient
- **Context Orchestration**: Client coordination and SwiftUI integration  
- **Intelligence System**: Architecture analysis and optimization capabilities
- **Capability System**: Runtime validation with compile-time optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated metrics collection and analysis

### Framework Capabilities Implementation
- **API Development**: Reduced boilerplate through builder patterns
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Reactive binding with defined relationships
- **Macro System**: @Client, @Context, @View macros implementation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Test framework implementation
- **Documentation**: Technical specifications and implementation guides

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Development Focus

**Framework Status**: Production-Ready Stability Achieved  
**Next Cycle**: Open for new proposals  
**Implementation Readiness**: 99.2% test success rate, 100% compilation success

### Available for Next Development Cycle

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduced boilerplate through code generation

### Quality Goals
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for framework components
- **Build Time**: Optimized framework build performance
- **API Satisfaction**: Developer experience assessment
- **Adoption**: Framework adoption and usage validation

## ðŸ”„ **Development Workflow**

### **Command Execution Cycle**
```bash
# Standard Development Cycle (5 Steps)
1. FrameworkProtocols/PLAN.md      # Read TRACKING.md priorities â†’ Create proposals
2. FrameworkProtocols/DEVELOP.md   # Implement proposals â†’ Update TRACKING.md progress
3. FrameworkProtocols/CHECKPOINT.md # Merge to main â†’ Update TRACKING.md completion
4. FrameworkProtocols/REFACTOR.md  # Structural improvements â†’ Update TRACKING.md quality
5. FrameworkProtocols/CHECKPOINT.md # Final merge â†’ Fresh cycle â†’ Update TRACKING.md
```

### **Command Separation of Concerns**
- **PLAN**: Reads TRACKING.md current priorities â†’ Creates structured development proposals
- **DEVELOP**: Implements proposals â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with implementation progress
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow management â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with merge completion
- **REFACTOR**: Code organization improvements â†’ Updates TRACKING.md with quality metrics
- **TRACKING**: Central progress coordination â†’ Updated by all commands

### **TRACKING.md Integration**
All commands integrate with TRACKING.md:
- **Read Operations**: PLAN.md reads current priorities and focuses development
- **Write Operations**: DEVELOP.md, CHECKPOINT.md, REFACTOR.md update progress and completion
- **Coordination**: TRACKING.md maintains current state across all development sessions
