## Format Example

### Complete Specification Example
```markdown
## Specification

### Requirements

#### State Management Component
- Thread-Safe State Access:
  - Requirement: All state mutations via concurrency control
  - Acceptance: Race condition test with 1000 concurrent operations shows no data corruption
  - Boundary: Public API exposes only async methods
  - Refactoring: Consider read-write lock if performance bottleneck
  
- Observable State Changes:
  - Requirement: State changes trigger observer notifications
  - Acceptance: Observer receives notification within 10ms of state change
  - Boundary: Test with mock observers only
  - Refactoring: Batch notifications if frequency > 100/sec
```

## Tracking Progress

The TDD Implementation Checklist (Section 9) tracks development progress:
- Mark items with [x] when complete
- Include test file references
- Note deferred refactorings
- Update timestamp each session

## Writing Guidelines

- **Specifications over prose**: Use bullet points for technical requirements
- **Testability first**: Every requirement has clear acceptance criteria
- **No implementation**: Define WHAT, not HOW
- **Measurable outcomes**: Quantify all constraints

## Key Principles

1. **Test-First Design**: Every requirement starts with a failing test
2. **Incremental Development**: Small, verifiable steps through TDD cycles
3. **Continuous Refactoring**: Improve design after each green test
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Define testing scope explicitly
5. **Measurable Success**: Quantifiable acceptance criteria
