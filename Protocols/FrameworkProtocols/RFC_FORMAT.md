# RFC Format Standards

RFC specifications for TDD-driven framework development.

## RFC Structure

### Metadata Header
```markdown
# RFC-XXX: [Title]

**RFC Number**: XXX  
**Title**: [Descriptive title]  
**Status**: Draft | Proposed | Active | Deprecated | Superseded  
**Type**: Architecture | Feature | Process | Standards  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Supersedes**: RFC-XXX (if applicable)  
**Superseded-By**: RFC-XXX (if applicable)
```

### Required Sections

1. **Abstract**: 2-3 paragraph summary of the proposal
2. **Motivation**: Problem statement and why this change is needed
3. **Specification**: Technical requirements with TDD criteria
4. **Rationale**: Design decisions and rejected alternatives
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Impact on existing code
6. **Security Considerations**: Threat model and mitigations
7. **Test Strategy**: Testing categories and validation approach
8. **References**: Related RFCs and documentation
9. **TDD Implementation Checklist**: Progress tracking for development sessions
10. **API Design**: Public interface contracts and evolution strategy
11. **Performance Constraints**: Framework overhead limits and benchmarks

## Specification Format

Each requirement must include:
- **Requirement**: What must be true
- **Acceptance**: How to verify it's working (measurable)
- **Boundary**: Scope of testing
- **Refactoring**: Optimization opportunities

### Example
```markdown
### Component Requirements
- Thread-Safe State Access:
  - Requirement: All state mutations via concurrency control
  - Acceptance: Race condition test with 1000 concurrent operations shows no data corruption
  - Boundary: Public API exposes only async methods
  - Refactoring: Consider read-write lock if performance bottleneck
  
- Observable State Changes:
  - Requirement: State changes trigger observer notifications
  - Acceptance: Observer receives notification within 10ms of state change
  - Boundary: Test with mock observers only
  - Refactoring: Batch notifications if frequency > 100/sec
```

## TDD Implementation Checklist Format

```markdown
## TDD Implementation Checklist

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Current Focus**: [Active component/requirement]
**Session Notes**: [Any blockers or decisions needed]

### Component A: [Name]
- [ ] Interface Definition
  - [x] Red: Test interface contract requirements
  - [x] Green: Define minimal interface  
  - [ ] Refactor: Add default implementations
- [ ] Concurrency Safety
  - [ ] Red: Test concurrent access patterns
  - [ ] Green: Implement thread-safe access
  - [ ] Refactor: Optimize for common usage
```

Track progress by:
- Marking items with [x] when complete
- Including test file references
- Noting deferred refactorings
- Updating timestamp each session

## Writing Guidelines

- **Specifications over prose**: Use bullet points for technical requirements
- **Testability first**: Every requirement has clear acceptance criteria
- **No implementation**: Define WHAT, not HOW
- **Measurable outcomes**: Quantify all constraints

## Key Principles

1. **Test-First Design**: Every requirement starts with a failing test
2. **Incremental Development**: Small, verifiable steps through TDD cycles
3. **Continuous Refactoring**: Improve design after each green test
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Define testing scope explicitly
5. **Measurable Success**: Quantifiable acceptance criteria
