# Axiom Framework: Branch-Aware Refactoring System

**Comprehensive code organization and structural improvements across development branches**

## ü§ñ Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@REFACTOR`
**Action**: Automatically enter ultrathink mode and execute branch-specific refactoring

**Branch-Aware Process**:
1. **Detect Current Branch** ‚Üí Determine refactoring scope (main, development, integration)
2. **Read REFACTOR.md** ‚Üí Load this complete branch-aware guide
3. **Check Branch Context** ‚Üí Understand current work and refactoring needs
4. **Execute Branch-Specific Refactoring** ‚Üí Organize and improve code within branch scope
5. **Update Progress** ‚Üí Mark refactoring tasks complete in appropriate documentation
6. **Prepare for Next Work** ‚Üí Ready clean environment for continued development

## üéØ REFACTOR Mode Mission

**Primary Focus**: Branch-specific code organization, structural improvements, and quality enhancements to maintain clean, maintainable, and efficient codebase without changing functionality.

**Enhanced Responsibility**: REFACTOR.md is the **Branch-Aware Organization Engine** - providing different refactoring scopes based on current branch context while maintaining code quality and structural integrity.

**Philosophy**: Well-organized code enables rapid development. Clean structure prevents technical debt and accelerates innovation. Branch-specific refactoring ensures focused improvements without cross-branch conflicts.
