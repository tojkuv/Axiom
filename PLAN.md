6. **Proposal Generation** → Generate technical enhancement proposals if in main branch
7. **Cross-Branch Coordination** → Plan work within branch scope and coordinate with other branches
8. **Documentation Updates** → Update branch-specific priorities and coordination status
9. **Smart Recommendations** → Provide intelligent next steps and priority suggestions

## 🎯 PLAN Mode Mission

**Primary Focus**: Intelligent branch-aware planning engine that automatically adapts to current branch context and repository state for optimal development coordination.

**Enhanced Responsibility**: PLAN.md is the **Unified Planning Intelligence System** - combining proposal generation, strategic coordination, and branch-specific planning into a single comprehensive planning engine that replaces the need for separate @PROPOSE.md functionality.

**Core Capabilities**:
- **Branch Intelligence**: Automatic branch detection and context-aware planning
- **Proposal Generation**: Technical enhancement proposal creation and management (main branch)
- **Repository Analysis**: Intelligent assessment of current project state and progress
- **Cross-Branch Coordination**: Strategic alignment across all development branches
- **Smart Prioritization**: Data-driven priority setting based on project needs and dependencies

**Philosophy**: Planning should be contextual, intelligent, and comprehensive. One planning system that understands your current context and automatically provides the right type of planning - whether that's framework development, integration testing, strategic coordination, or technical proposal generation.
