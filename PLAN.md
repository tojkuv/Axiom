# Axiom Framework: Multi-Terminal Development Planning Command

**Central planning coordination for three simultaneous Claude Code terminals**

## ü§ñ Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@PLAN`
**Action**: Automatically enter ultrathink mode and execute terminal-aware planning

**Enhanced Process**:
1. **Detect Terminal Context** ‚Üí Determine which terminal: main (refactor), development (framework), integration (test app)
2. **Read PLAN.md** ‚Üí Load this complete planning guide with multi-terminal coordination protocols
3. **Check ROADMAP.md** ‚Üí Assess current status, completed work, and cross-terminal coordination
4. **Terminal Coordination** ‚Üí Coordinate with other active terminals through ROADMAP.md
5. **Plan Terminal Work** ‚Üí Identify tasks for current terminal based on context and other terminal states
6. **Update ROADMAP.md** ‚Üí Update terminal-specific priorities and coordination status for other terminals to see

## üéØ PLAN Mode Mission

**Primary Focus**: Coordinate three simultaneous Claude Code terminals with real-time parallel work coordination.

**Enhanced Responsibility**: PLAN.md is the **Multi-Terminal Coordination Manager** - maintaining roadmap health, coordinating parallel work across terminals, and ensuring conflict-free development through real-time status updates.

**Philosophy**: Multi-terminal planning enables true parallel development and integration while maintaining code quality and avoiding merge conflicts through intelligent coordination via ROADMAP.md as the central communication hub.

## üñ•Ô∏è Three-Terminal Planning System

### **Terminal 1: Main Branch** ‚Üí Comprehensive Refactoring Context
**When Active**: ONLY when Terminal 2 (development) and Terminal 3 (integration) are both inactive/not committing
**Purpose**: Comprehensive refactoring across entire codebase - framework, test app, and documentation
**Focus**: 
- Refactor framework code structure and organization in `/AxiomFramework/`
- Refactor test app code structure and organization in `/AxiomTestApp/`
- Improve cross-system consistency and architectural alignment
- Archive completed development phases and organize documentation
- Enhance code quality, maintainability, and performance patterns
**Coordination**: Must check ROADMAP.md for other terminal activity before starting work

### **Terminal 2: Development Branch** ‚Üí Framework Planning Context  
**When Active**: Can run parallel with Terminal 3 (integration), must coordinate with Terminal 1 (main)
**Purpose**: Framework core enhancement and new capabilities
**Focus**:
- Implement framework limitations discovered through integration
- Build new protocol implementations and capabilities
- Design enhanced capability system features
- Improve intelligence system accuracy and performance
**Coordination**: Updates ROADMAP.md status for other terminals, coordinates file changes with Terminal 3

### **Terminal 3: Integration Branch** ‚Üí Test App Planning Context
**When Active**: Can run parallel with Terminal 2 (development), must coordinate with Terminal 1 (main)
**Purpose**: Real-world validation and API refinement in AxiomTestApp
**Focus**:
- Validate new framework features in real-world scenarios
- Test API ergonomics and developer experience improvements
- Discover usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- Measure performance against established targets
**Coordination**: Updates ROADMAP.md status for other terminals, coordinates file changes with Terminal 2

## üîÑ Multi-Terminal Coordination Principles

### **Terminal Activity Rules**
- **Terminal 2 + Terminal 3**: Can work simultaneously on different file scopes
- **Terminal 1 Exclusivity**: Refactor work ONLY when Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 are both completely inactive and not working on commits
- **Real-Time Coordination**: All terminals use ROADMAP.md as central communication hub
- **Manual Merge Control**: User decides when and how to merge branches from any terminal

### **Terminal File Coordination Strategy**
- **Terminal 2 (Development)**: New feature development in `/AxiomFramework/Sources/`, `/AxiomFramework/Tests/`, `/AxiomFramework/Package.swift`
- **Terminal 3 (Integration)**: New integration testing in `/AxiomTestApp/`, integration documentation  
- **Terminal 1 (Main)**: **COMPREHENSIVE REFACTORING** across entire codebase `/AxiomFramework/`, `/AxiomTestApp/`, `/Documentation/` - but ONLY when Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 are IDLE
- **Coordination Principle**: Terminal 1 can refactor any code, but must wait for Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 to be completely inactive to avoid conflicts
- **Shared Communication**: ROADMAP.md Terminal Status section used for real-time coordination

### **Terminal Status Communication**
- **ROADMAP.md Terminal Status Section**: Each terminal updates its current activity status
- **Commit/Push Notifications**: Terminals announce when they're actively committing/pushing
- **Quiet Period Detection**: Terminal 1 monitors for Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 inactivity
- **Cross-Terminal Awareness**: Each terminal checks other terminal status before major operations

### **Integration with PROPOSE.md**
**Strategic Improvement Coordination**: PROPOSE.md provides comprehensive strategic analysis and improvement proposals that can influence PLAN.md decisions across all branches.

**When to Use PROPOSE**:
- Major milestone completion requiring strategic assessment
- Innovation opportunity identification and evaluation  
- Architectural rethinking and optimization needs
- Process improvement and development velocity enhancement

**PROPOSE ‚Üí PLAN Flow**:
1. **PROPOSE.md** ‚Üí Generates strategic improvement proposals
2. **User Selection** ‚Üí User chooses which proposals to implement
3. **PLAN.md Integration** ‚Üí Approved proposals influence branch planning and priority adjustments
4. **Implementation Coordination** ‚Üí PLAN.md coordinates proposal implementation across development/integration/main branches

## üßπ ROADMAP HEALTH MANAGEMENT

**PLAN.md Enhanced Responsibility**: As the Roadmap Health Manager, PLAN.md maintains a clean, forward-looking roadmap focused on current and upcoming work, not historical accumulation.

### **Roadmap Health Targets**
- **Active Content**: <300 lines total roadmap size
- **Navigation Speed**: <30 seconds to find current sprint status  
- **Decision Efficiency**: <2 minutes to plan next cycle from clean roadmap
- **Historical Access**: All completed work preserved but archived, not cluttering active planning

### **Core Roadmap Maintenance Operations**

#### **Phase A: Roadmap Health Assessment**
1. **Size Analysis** ‚Üí Check if ROADMAP.md exceeds 300 lines or clutters current priorities
2. **Historical Content Review** ‚Üí Identify completed phases/cycles ready for archival
3. **Navigation Efficiency Check** ‚Üí Ensure current sprint and priorities are immediately visible
4. **Cleanup Opportunity Identification** ‚Üí Find redundant, outdated, or overly detailed historical content

#### **Phase B: Archive Management** 
1. **Create Archive Documents** ‚Üí Move completed phases to `/Documentation/Archive/` with comprehensive detail preservation
2. **Archive Navigation Updates** ‚Üí Ensure archived content remains accessible through clear links
3. **Historical Summarization** ‚Üí Replace detailed completed sections with concise summaries + archive links
4. **Learning Preservation** ‚Üí Maintain important discoveries and patterns in accessible archive format

#### **Phase C: Current Priority Optimization**
1. **Prominent Current Sprint** ‚Üí Ensure active work is the first thing users see
2. **Clear Priority Queue** ‚Üí Make next 2-3 priorities immediately obvious for rapid planning
3. **Completed Priority Removal** ‚Üí Archive achieved priorities, advance priority queue
4. **Decision-Making Optimization** ‚Üí Structure roadmap for rapid cycle coordination

#### **Phase D: Roadmap Quality Validation**
1. **Size Compliance** ‚Üí Verify roadmap remains <300 lines and navigable
2. **Content Focus** ‚Üí Confirm roadmap emphasizes current/future work over historical achievements
3. **Archive Integrity** ‚Üí Validate all archived content is properly linked and accessible
4. **Planning Efficiency** ‚Üí Test that clean roadmap enables faster cycle selection

### **Archive Strategy and Organization**

#### **Archive File Structure**
```
/Documentation/Archive/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PHASE_1_2_FOUNDATION_ARCHIVE.md          # Detailed Phase 1-2 achievements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DEVELOP_DELIVERABLES_ARCHIVE.md          # Historical development achievements  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ INTEGRATE_DELIVERABLES_ARCHIVE.md        # Historical integration results

- AxiomIntelligence concrete actor development  
- Comprehensive test suite establishment
```

### **Command Mode Separation of Concerns**

#### **What PLAN.md DOES (Roadmap Health Manager)**
- ‚úÖ **Current Sprint Management**: Updates CURRENT SPRINT STATUS with new cycle coordination
- ‚úÖ **Priority Queue Management**: Maintains UPCOMING PRIORITIES based on cycle completions
- ‚úÖ **Roadmap Cleanup**: Archives completed work, maintains <300 line target
- ‚úÖ **Historical Organization**: Ensures completed work is preserved but not cluttering
- ‚úÖ **Planning Coordination**: Traditional cycle planning based on clean, focused roadmap

#### **What PLAN.md DOES NOT DO**
- ‚ùå **Framework Implementation**: No coding, no technical development work
- ‚ùå **Integration Testing**: No AxiomTestApp validation or performance measurement
- ‚ùå **Documentation Organization**: No technical docs structure (that's REFACTOR.md)
- ‚ùå **Strategic Analysis**: No strategic proposals (that's PROPOSE.md)

#### **What Other Modes DO NOT DO**
- **DEVELOP.md**: ‚ùå No roadmap cleanup, ‚ùå No priority management, ‚ùå No cycle planning
- **INTEGRATE.md**: ‚ùå No roadmap updates, ‚ùå No sprint coordination, ‚ùå No historical archival  
- **REFACTOR.md**: ‚ùå No roadmap maintenance, ‚ùå No sprint planning, ‚ùå No priority management
- **PROPOSE.md**: ‚ùå No direct roadmap changes, ‚ùå No cycle coordination, ‚ùå No implementation

## üìã Multi-Terminal ROADMAP.md Management Protocol

**PLAN.md is the ONLY mode that updates CURRENT SPRINT STATUS and UPCOMING PRIORITIES**

**ENHANCED RESPONSIBILITY**: PLAN.md is the **Multi-Terminal Coordination Manager** - the only mode that maintains roadmap health AND coordinates real-time status between three simultaneous terminals.

### **ROADMAP.md Terminal Status Section** (NEW)

Each terminal must update its status in ROADMAP.md for cross-terminal coordination:

```markdown
## üñ•Ô∏è TERMINAL STATUS (Real-Time Coordination)

### **Terminal 1 (Main Branch)** 
**Status**: [ACTIVE/WAITING/IDLE] 
**Current Work**: [Description of current refactor/organization work]
**Blocking For**: [Waiting for Terminal 2 and/or Terminal 3 to go idle]
