# APPLICATION_ANALYZE_PROTOCOL.md

Analyze single application implementation to extract actionable framework insights through focused test-driven development metrics and pain point identification. Uses robust unique numbering system to ensure each analysis has a collision-free identifier.

## Protocol Activation

```
@APPLICATION_ANALYZE generate [framework-doc] [api-reference] [cycle-folder] [analysis-template] [optional-args]
```

## Commands

```
generate [framework-doc] [api-reference] [cycle-folder] [analysis-template] [previous-analysis-timestamp-id?]     → Generate analysis with unique timestamp ID
```

**Note**: The protocol automatically generates timestamp-based unique IDs (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) to ensure no conflicts with existing or concurrent analyses.

## Process Flow

```
1. Generate unique analysis identifier using robust numbering system
2. Verify uniqueness against all existing FW-ANALYSIS-*.md files
3. Scan cycle folder for TDD session insights and pain points
4. Aggregate framework friction metrics and workarounds
5. Identify high-impact improvement opportunities
6. Generate actionable framework requirements
7. Create analysis with guaranteed unique identifier
8. Validate no conflicts with existing or concurrent analyses
```

## Unique Analysis Identification System

### Robust Unique ID Generation
The protocol automatically:
1. Generates timestamp-based unique identifier (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)
2. Scans framework folder for ALL existing FW-ANALYSIS-*.md files
3. Verifies generated ID is unique across all existing analyses
4. If collision detected (extremely rare), appends suffix (-A, -B, etc.)
5. Creates analysis with guaranteed unique identifier

### Naming Convention
```
FW-ANALYSIS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-[APPLICATION-NAME].md
```
- YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS: Timestamp-based unique identifier
- APPLICATION-NAME: Derived from cycle folder name
- Example: FW-ANALYSIS-20241210-143052-TASK-MANAGER-MVP.md

### Collision Prevention (Robust)
Multiple layers of conflict prevention:
```
Generating analysis ID: 20241210-143052
Scanning existing analyses...
✓ No collision detected

If collision occurs (rare):
Detected collision: FW-ANALYSIS-20241210-143052-TASK-MANAGER-MVP.md exists
Generating alternative: 20241210-143052-A
✓ Verified unique: FW-ANALYSIS-20241210-143052-A-TASK-MANAGER-MVP.md
```

### Benefits Over Sequential Numbering
- **True Uniqueness**: Timestamp guarantees no conflicts across time
- **Concurrent Safe**: Multiple analyses can generate simultaneously
- **Gap Tolerant**: No issues with missing numbers in sequence
- **Chronological**: File creation time visible in filename
- **Collision Resistant**: Multiple fallback mechanisms

### Technical Implementation

#### ID Generation Algorithm
```
1. Get current timestamp: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
2. Scan framework folder for pattern: FW-ANALYSIS-{timestamp}-*.md
3. If no collision: Use timestamp as ID
4. If collision found: Append suffix -A, -B, -C, etc.
5. Verify final ID is unique
6. Create analysis file with unique ID
```

#### Collision Resolution Strategy
```
Primary ID: 20241210-143052
If collision: 20241210-143052-A
If collision: 20241210-143052-B
...continuing through alphabet if needed
```

#### Error Handling
- **File System Errors**: Retry with different timestamp
- **Permission Issues**: Clear error message with resolution steps
- **Concurrent Generation**: Each process gets unique timestamp
- **Invalid Characters**: Sanitize application names for filesystem compatibility

#### Verification Process
Every generated analysis undergoes verification:
1. **Uniqueness Check**: Scan all existing FW-ANALYSIS-* files
2. **Filesystem Validation**: Ensure filename is valid for target OS
3. **Content Integrity**: Verify analysis template application succeeded
4. **Reference Validation**: Confirm all cross-references are valid

### Analysis Reference Strategy

When referencing analyses in requirements or other documents:
- Use full filename for precision: "FW-ANALYSIS-20241210-143052-TASK-MANAGER-MVP"
- Maintain chronological order when listing related analyses
- Include timestamp ID in all cross-references for maximum clarity

#### Benefits of Timestamp System
- **True Uniqueness**: Collision-resistant timestamps guarantee no conflicts
- **Chronological Clarity**: Analysis sequence and timing immediately visible
- **Automated Management**: No manual coordination or ID assignment required
