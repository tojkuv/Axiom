# FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP_PROTOCOL.md

Implement framework improvements through test-driven development focused on validated pain points from application development cycles.

## Protocol Activation

```text
@FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP [command] [arguments]
```

## Commands

```text
start [requirements-id]    → Begin implementing framework improvements targeting specific pain points
resume [requirements-id]   → Continue implementation tracking pain point resolution
test [requirements-id]     → Validate improvements against original issues
benchmark [requirements-id] → Measure performance improvements and overhead
status [requirements-id]   → Show progress on pain point resolution
finalize [requirements-id] → Confirm improvements ready for application validation
```

## Process Flow

```text
1. Start from requirements driven by application pain points
2. Write tests that validate pain point resolution
3. Implement minimal solutions that address core issues
4. Refactor for framework consistency and performance
5. Validate improvements against original problems
```

## Command Details

### Start Command

Begin implementing improvements for validated pain points:

```bash
@FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP start 002
```

The start command now emphasizes understanding the original pain points that drove each requirement, writing tests that specifically validate those pain points are resolved, and tracking implementation time against estimated improvement benefits. This ensures development effort focuses on actual developer needs rather than theoretical improvements.

Output:
```
Starting REQUIREMENTS-002-BATCH-OPERATIONS implementation

Pain Points Being Addressed:
- DataStore saves taking 3+ seconds for 100 items (CYCLE-001, Session 3)
- Transaction boilerplate requiring 50+ lines (CYCLE-001, Session 5)
- No way to optimize bulk operations (CYCLE-002, Session 2)

Target Improvements:
- Reduce 100-item save time to <100ms
- Provide single-line batch API
- Enable transaction optimizations

Created tests validating pain point resolution:
  ✗ testBatchSavePerformance - Must be <100ms for 100 items
  ✗ testBatchAPISimplicity - Must work in single line
  ✗ testTransactionOptimization - Must batch automatically

Session: FW-SESSION-001.md focused on validated improvements
```

### Resume Command

Continue implementation with pain point awareness:

```bash
@FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP resume 002
```

The resume command maintains focus on the original problems being solved, showing progress against specific pain points rather than just technical tasks. It tracks which issues are resolved and which still need work, ensuring the implementation stays aligned with developer needs.

### Test Command

Validate improvements against original scenarios:

```bash
@FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP test 002
```

The test command now includes specific validation that the original pain points are resolved, using test cases derived from actual application usage patterns. It verifies not just that new APIs work, but that they solve the problems they were designed to address.

Output:
```
Running validation tests for v002 improvements...

Pain Point Resolution Tests:
  ✓ Batch save performance - 87ms for 100 items (was 3,200ms)
  ✓ API simplicity - Single line usage confirmed
  ✓ Transaction optimization - Automatic batching working
  ✓ Backward compatibility - Existing apps unaffected

Original Scenario Validation:
  ✓ CYCLE-001 Session 3 case - Now completes in 0.1s
  ✓ CYCLE-001 Session 5 pattern - Reduced to 5 lines
  ✓ CYCLE-002 Session 2 optimization - Now automatic

All pain points successfully addressed
```

### Benchmark Command

Measure actual improvement against projections:

```bash
@FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP benchmark 002
```

Benchmarking now focuses on validating that the improvements deliver the projected benefits, comparing actual results against the estimates made during requirements planning. This ensures the framework evolution delivers real value to developers.

### Status Command

Track pain point resolution progress:

```bash
@FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP status 002
```

Status reporting emphasizes which original pain points are resolved, which are still being addressed, and whether any new issues have been discovered during implementation. This maintains clear traceability from problem to solution.

### Finalize Command

Confirm improvements ready for validation:

```bash
@FRAMEWORK_DEVELOP finalize 002
```

Finalization includes explicit verification that all targeted pain points are addressed, the solutions work in realistic scenarios, and no new friction has been introduced. It prepares clear validation criteria for the next application cycle.

## Pain Point Driven Development

### Understanding Original Context
Each implementation session begins by reviewing the original application sessions where pain points were discovered. This includes understanding the specific code that was problematic, the time lost to workarounds, and the developer frustration involved. This context ensures solutions address real problems effectively.

### Test Design for Validation
Tests are designed to validate that specific pain points are resolved, not just that new features work. This includes tests that reproduce original problematic scenarios, verify new APIs eliminate previous workarounds, confirm performance meets targets that would have prevented the original issues, and ensure the developer experience matches expectations.

### Implementation Focus
Implementation prioritizes solving the core pain points with minimal complexity. The goal is reducing developer friction, not adding features. This means favoring simple APIs over flexible ones when simplicity addresses the pain point, optimizing for common cases that caused problems, and maintaining framework consistency while solving specific issues.

### Refactoring for Quality
Refactoring phases focus on ensuring solutions integrate well with existing framework patterns while maintaining their effectiveness at solving original problems. This includes extracting reusable patterns from solutions, optimizing without compromising usability, and ensuring solutions guide developers toward best practices.

## Validation Throughout Development

### Continuous Pain Point Checking
Throughout implementation, developers continuously validate against original pain points by asking whether the current approach would prevent the original problem, if the solution feels natural to developers facing that issue, and whether any new complexity is justified by the improvement gained.

### Early Validation with Examples
Implementation includes creating examples based on original problematic code to verify solutions work in practice. This catches issues early when adjustments are easier and ensures solutions work for real use cases, not just theoretical ones.

### Performance Validation
For performance-related pain points, continuous benchmarking ensures solutions meet targets. This includes testing with realistic data sizes from applications, measuring overhead in typical usage patterns, and verifying improvements scale appropriately.

## Session Enhancement

### Focused Session Tracking
Sessions now emphasize tracking progress against specific pain points rather than general development tasks. Each session documents which pain points were addressed, how solutions evolved based on testing, what insights emerged about the original problems, and whether any new issues were discovered.

### Decision Documentation
API design decisions are documented with explicit reference to the pain points they address. This includes why specific approaches were chosen to solve problems, what alternatives were considered and rejected, and how the solution balances simplicity with effectiveness.
