## TDD Development Log

### RED Phase - [Feature/API or Refactoring Target]

**IMPLEMENTATION Test Written**: Validates solution addresses pain point
```swift
// Actual test written in framework test suite
func testPainPointXXXResolved() async throws {
    // Real test code written to verify new behavior
    let manager = StateManager()
    await manager.performNewCapability()
    XCTAssertTrue(manager.painPointResolved)
}
```

**REFACTORING Test Written**: Preserves current behavior during refactoring
```swift
// Actual behavior preservation test written
func testCurrentBehaviorPreserved() async throws {
    // Real test ensuring refactoring preserves functionality
    let result = existingAPI.performOperation()
    XCTAssertEqual(result, expectedBehavior)
}
```

**Development Insight**: [Framework design insights discovered while coding]

### GREEN Phase - [Feature/API or Refactoring Target]

**IMPLEMENTATION Code Written**: [Actual implementation completed]
```swift
// Minimal implementation written to make test pass
public func performNewCapability() async {
    // Real code written to resolve pain point
    self.persistentState.store(capability: true)
}
```

**REFACTORING Code Changes**: [Actual refactoring performed]
```swift
// Before refactoring (Original code - 45 lines)
class StateManager {
    func updateA() { /* 15 lines duplicate logic */ }
    func updateB() { /* 15 lines duplicate logic */ }
    func updateC() { /* 15 lines duplicate logic */ }
}

// After refactoring (Simplified code - 12 lines)
class StateManager {
    func update(_ type: UpdateType) { /* 8 lines shared logic */ }
}
```

**Compatibility Check**: [Measured impacts on existing APIs]
**Code Metrics**: [Actual lines changed, complexity reduction measured, duplication removed]

### REFACTOR Phase - [Feature/API or Refactoring Target]

**IMPLEMENTATION Optimization Performed**: [Performance/API design/Testability improvements made]
```swift
// Actual refined implementation with extracted patterns
protocol CapabilityProvider {
    func performCapability() async
}
extension StateManager: CapabilityProvider {
    func performCapability() async {
        await performNewCapability()
    }
}
```

**REFACTORING Optimization Performed**: [Additional simplification/performance improvements made]
```swift
// Further optimized implementation (final code)
class StateManager {
    private let updateStrategy: UpdateStrategy
    func update(_ type: UpdateType) { updateStrategy.execute(type) }
}
```

**Pattern Extracted**: [Reusable pattern created for framework]
**Measured Results**: [Actual performance improvements, complexity reduction achieved]

## API Design Decisions

### Decision: [API design choice]
**Rationale**: Based on pain point from [application cycle]
**Alternative Considered**: [Other approach]
**Why This Approach**: [Specific benefits for developers]
**Test Impact**: [How this makes testing easier]

## Integration Testing

### With Existing Framework Components
```swift
// Actual integration test written and executed
func testIntegrationWithStateManager() {
    let manager = StateManager()
    let capability = CapabilityManager(stateManager: manager)
    XCTAssertNoThrow(try capability.executeWithState())
}
```
Result: PASS ✅

### Sample Usage Test
```swift
// Real application scenario test executed
func testApplicationPainPointResolved() {
    // This test replicates the original pain point scenario
    let app = TestApplication()
    app.performPreviouslyPainfulOperation()
    XCTAssertEqual(app.executionTime, .fast) // Was .slow before
}
```
Result: Pain point resolved ✅
