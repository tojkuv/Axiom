// Test that validates the improvement
func testPainPointXXXResolved() async throws {
    // Test showing desired behavior
}
```
**Insight**: [Any framework design insights from writing test]

### [HH:MM] GREEN Phase - [Feature/API]
**Implementation Time**: X minutes
**Approach**: [How implementing to pass test]
```swift
// Minimal implementation 
```
**Compatibility Check**: [Any impacts on existing APIs]

### [HH:MM] REFACTOR Phase - [Feature/API]
**Optimization Focus**: [Performance/API design/Testability]
**Time**: X minutes
```swift
// Refined implementation
```
**Pattern Emerged**: [Reusable pattern for framework]

## API Design Decisions
