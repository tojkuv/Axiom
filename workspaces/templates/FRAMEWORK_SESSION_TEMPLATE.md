## TDD Cycles

### Cycle 1: [Feature/API]
**Requirement**: REQ-XXX
**Time**: XX minutes

#### RED (Test First)
```swift
func testBatchSaveAPI() async throws {
    // Testing new batch save functionality
    let items = (0..<100).map { TestModel(name: "Item \($0)") }

    let saved = try await store.saveMany(items)

    XCTAssertEqual(saved.count, 100)
    XCTAssertTrue(saved.allSatisfy { $0.id != nil })
}
```
**Result**: Failed - `saveMany` method doesn't exist

#### GREEN (Implementation)
```swift
public extension DataStore {
    func saveMany<T: Model>(_ items: [T]) async throws -> [T] {
        // Naive implementation to make test pass
        var results: [T] = []
        for item in items {
            results.append(try await save(item))
        }
        return results
    }
}
```
**Result**: Test passes but performance poor

#### REFACTOR (Optimize)
```swift
public extension DataStore {
    func saveMany<T: Model>(_ items: [T]) async throws -> [T] {
        try await transaction { context in
            let chunks = items.chunked(into: batchSize)
            return try await chunks.asyncFlatMap { chunk in
                try await context.batchInsert(chunk)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Result**: Tests pass, performance improved 89%

#### Insights
- Transaction wrapper essential for performance
- Chunk size affects memory usage
- Need to document batch size tuning

### Cycle 2: [Next Feature]
[Repeat pattern for significant changes]

## API Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Async/Await Pattern
**Choice**: Make all new APIs async
**Rationale**:
- Consistency with Swift concurrency
- Better performance potential
- Cleaner error handling
**Impact**: All new APIs will be async-first

### Decision 2: Generic Constraints
**Choice**: Use protocol constraints vs concrete types
**Rationale**:
- More flexible for users
- Enables custom model types
- Better testability

## Performance Measurements

### Benchmark Results
```
Operation               | Items | Time    | Memory
------------------------|-------|---------|--------
saveMany (new)         | 10    | 12ms    | 0.5MB
loop save (old)        | 10    | 73ms    | 0.5MB
saveMany (new)         | 100   | 45ms    | 2.1MB
loop save (old)        | 100   | 512ms   | 2.0MB
saveMany (new)         | 1000  | 342ms   | 18MB
loop save (old)        | 1000  | 3,891ms | 17MB
```

### Optimization Notes
- Chunk size 50 optimal for memory/speed
- Transaction overhead ~10ms
- Parallel processing not beneficial <100 items

## Code Metrics

### Added
- `Sources/AxiomData/BatchOperations.swift` (234 lines)
- `Tests/AxiomDataTests/BatchOperationTests.swift` (456 lines)
- `Sources/AxiomData/Transaction.swift` (123 lines)

### Modified
- `Sources/AxiomData/DataStore.swift` (+67, -12 lines)
- `Sources/AxiomData/Models/Model.swift` (+23, -0 lines)

### Test Coverage
- Starting: 94.1%
- Ending: 96.2% (+2.1%)
- New code coverage: 98.5%

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Transaction Deadlocks
**Issue**: Nested transactions causing deadlocks
**Investigation**: 45 minutes debugging
**Solution**: Detect and coalesce nested transactions
**Learning**: Document transaction boundaries clearly

### Challenge 2: Memory Pressure
**Issue**: Large batches causing memory spikes
**Investigation**: Profiling showed unbounded growth
**Solution**: Implement automatic chunking
**Learning**: Add memory limit documentation

## Framework Architecture Notes

### Layering Maintained
- Public API in AxiomData
- Implementation details hidden
- Test utilities extended
- No cross-layer violations

### New Patterns Introduced
1. Transaction context pattern
2. Batch operation protocol
3. Async sequence extensions

## Session Reflection

### What Worked Well
- TDD flow very smooth
- Performance gains exceeded expectations
- Clean API design from start

### What Was Difficult
- Transaction complexity higher than expected
- Memory profiling tools limited
- Async testing still has rough edges

### Key Learnings
- Chunking strategy crucial for performance
- Transaction boundaries need careful design
- Benchmark early and often

### Time Breakdown
- Planning: 20 min
- TDD cycles: 2 hours
- Performance testing: 45 min
- Documentation: 25 min

**Total Productive Time**: 3.5 hours

## Notes for Documentation
- Emphasize batch size tuning
- Include transaction examples
- Warning about memory limits
- Performance comparison chart
