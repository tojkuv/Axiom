## Framework Integration

### APIs Used
- **Client Pattern**: State management and actor isolation
  - Observation: Thread safety built-in, works well
- **Context-Presentation Binding**: UI state synchronization  
  - Observation: Lifecycle methods need careful handling
- **Capability Abstraction**: External service integration
  - Observation: Good testability, clean separation

### Friction Points
1. **Issue**: DataStore requires individual saves
   - **Context**: Importing 100 items takes too long
   - **Workaround**: Manual batching with transactions
   - **Suggestion**: Add native batch API

2. **Issue**: [Next friction point]
   - **Context**: [When encountered]
   - **Workaround**: [How solved]
   - **Suggestion**: [Framework improvement]

### Successful Patterns
1. **Pattern**: Repository wrapper around DataStore
   - **Description**: Abstraction layer for data operations
   - **Benefit**: Cleaner code, testability
   - **Reusability**: High
   - **Framework Alignment**: Follows Capability pattern

## Test Coverage

### Requirement Test Progress
- REQ-001: 3/3 RED tests passing
- REQ-002: 2/3 RED tests passing
- REQ-003: 0/3 RED tests written
- REQ-004: 0/3 RED tests written
- REQ-005: 0/3 RED tests written

### Framework Component Coverage
- Client: 4/5 scenarios tested
- State: 3/3 scenarios tested
- Context: 2/4 scenarios tested
- Presentation: 1/3 scenarios tested
- Capability: 2/3 scenarios tested

### Coverage Notes
- Focused on Client and State testing
- Context lifecycle needs more coverage
- Presentation binding tests pending

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Decision 1
**Context**: REQ-008 Navigation checklist
**Choice**: Use framework's Orchestrator pattern
**Rationale**: Aligns with framework architecture
**Impact**: Consistent navigation approach

### Architecture Decision 2
**Context**: REQ-002 Persistence checklist
**Choice**: Implement Capability protocol
**Rationale**: Framework requires capability abstraction
**Impact**: Better testability and isolation

## Implementation Progress

### Components Created
- Client implementation for REQ-001
- State structure for REQ-001
- Context binding for REQ-003
- Test suite for RED phase validation

### Checklist-Driven Changes
- REQ-001: Implemented 2/3 GREEN items
- REQ-002: Created capability structure
- REQ-003: Started context observation

### Refactoring Notes
- Applied framework patterns discovered
- Improved test organization
- Enhanced error handling approach

## Performance Observations

- Task list scrolling smooth up to 1000 items
- Filter operation takes 50-200ms (acceptable)
- Memory usage stable at ~45MB
- No retain cycles detected

## Next Session Planning

### Priority Checklist Items
1. [ ] Complete REQ-003 GREEN phase (1 remaining)
2. [ ] Start REQ-003 REFACTOR phase (3 items)
3. [ ] Begin REQ-004 RED phase tests

### Framework Testing Focus
1. [ ] Validate Context lifecycle methods
2. [ ] Test AsyncStream with multiple observers
3. [ ] Verify Capability error handling

### Technical Debt
1. [ ] Address thread safety verification from Cycle 3
2. [ ] Improve test coverage for edge cases
3. [ ] Document discovered patterns

## Session Reflection

### What Went Well
- TDD flow was smooth after initial setup
- Framework UI components saved significant time
- Test utilities made assertions cleaner

### What Was Challenging
- Understanding DataStore transaction boundaries
- Debugging async test failures
- Managing view state complexity

### Learning Notes
- Framework's @StateBinding reduces boilerplate significantly
- Test data builders pattern very effective
- Need better understanding of performance profiling tools
