- Post-release monitoring and analytics

## ü§ñ Application Development Workflow

```bash
# Complete application development lifecycle
ApplicationDevelopment/FEATURE.md    # Develop new application features
ApplicationDevelopment/DEPLOY.md     # Deploy to staging and production
ApplicationDevelopment/MAINTAIN.md   # Ongoing maintenance and optimization
ApplicationDevelopment/SHIP.md       # Ship releases to App Store
```

## üèóÔ∏è Application Development Philosophy

**User Experience Focus**: These commands prioritize creating high-quality user experiences that leverage Axiom's capabilities for maximum impact.

**Business Value Delivery**: Every feature and release should provide clear user value while maintaining high performance and reliability standards.

**Axiom Pattern Usage**: Leverage the framework's AI-agent capabilities, architectural constraints, and performance optimizations for optimal results.

## üì± Axiom Framework Integration

### **Framework Capabilities You'll Use**
- **Actor State Management** - Thread-safe state with automatic UI updates
- **SwiftUI Integration** - Reactive binding with 1:1 view-context relationships  
- **Runtime Capabilities** - Validation with graceful degradation
- **Intelligence Queries** - AI-powered architecture exploration
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in metrics and optimization
- **Streamlined APIs** - 70-80% boilerplate reduction

### **Example Axiom Usage**
```swift
// Use released Axiom framework
import Axiom

// Axiom-powered actor with capabilities
actor UserClient: AxiomClient {
    typealias State = UserState
    // Leverage framework's state management
}

// Axiom context orchestration
class UserContext: AxiomContext {
    // Use framework's client coordination
}

// Axiom view integration
struct UserView: AxiomView {
    // Leverage framework's SwiftUI integration
}
```

## üß† AI Agent Integration

All application development commands are optimized for autonomous AI agent execution with:
- Business requirement translation
- User experience optimization
- Automated testing and validation
- Release management automation

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

**Axiom Framework**: Use released versions of Axiom framework from official releases, not development versions.

**iOS Development**: Standard iOS development setup with Xcode and Swift Package Manager.

**Production Ready**: These commands are designed for building production applications that will be shipped to real users.
