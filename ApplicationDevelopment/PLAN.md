# @PLAN.md - Axiom Application Development Planning Command

Application development planning command that creates proposals for application implementation

## Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@PLAN [optional-args]`
**Action**: Enter ultrathink mode and execute application development planning workflow

### Usage Modes
- **`@PLAN`** → Create application development proposal in AxiomTestApp/Proposals/Active/
- **`@PLAN plan`** → Plan application development tasks and create proposal
- **`@PLAN validate`** → Plan application validation and create testing proposal
- **`@PLAN enhance`** → Plan application enhancements and user experience improvements

### Application Planning Scope
**Planning Focus**: Application development proposal creation and strategic planning
**Branch Requirement**: Must be executed from application branch for application development
**Proposal Creation**: Creates structured application proposals for user review and revision
**Development Integration**: Proposals are implemented through ApplicationDevelopment/DEVELOP.md after user approval

### 🔄 **Standardized Git Workflow**
All ApplicationDevelopment commands follow this workflow:
1. **Branch Setup**: Switch to `application` branch (create if doesn't exist)
2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `application` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `application` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `application` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `application` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Application Development Planning Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Application planning creates detailed proposals for application development that can be reviewed, revised, and approved by users before implementation begins.

**Proposal Workflow**: @PLAN creates application proposals → User reviews/revises → ApplicationDevelopment/DEVELOP.md implements → Progress tracked in ApplicationDevelopment/TRACKING.md

### 🎯 **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **PLAN**: Reads TRACKING.md priorities → Creates proposals → NO implementation
- **DEVELOP**: Implements proposals → Updates TRACKING.md progress → NO planning
- **CHECKPOINT**: Git workflow → Updates TRACKING.md completion → NO development
- **REFACTOR**: Code organization → Updates TRACKING.md quality → NO functionality changes
- **TRACKING**: Central progress store → Updated by all commands → NO command execution

**Quality Standards**: Application proposals include comprehensive technical specifications, implementation approaches, and success criteria

## Application Planning Methodology

### Phase 1: Application Analysis
1. **TRACKING.md Review** → Read current priorities, progress, and next actions from ApplicationDevelopment/TRACKING.md
2. **Current Application Assessment** → Analyze current application implementation status and needs
3. **Requirements Analysis** → Understand application development objectives and constraints
4. **Technical Assessment** → Evaluate application technical approaches and implementation strategies
5. **User Experience Planning** → Assess application user experience changes and resource requirements
6. **Success Criteria Definition** → Define measurable application outcomes and validation criteria

### Phase 2: Application Proposal Creation
1. **Technical Specification** → Create detailed application technical approach and architecture
2. **Implementation Planning** → Plan application development phases and implementation steps
3. **Testing Strategy** → Define application testing approach and validation procedures
4. **Documentation Planning** → Plan application documentation updates and requirements
5. **Integration Strategy** → Define integration with existing application codebase and framework

### Phase 3: Application Proposal Documentation
1. **Structured Format** → Create application proposal using established format and sections
2. **Technical Details** → Include comprehensive application technical specifications and approaches
3. **Implementation Roadmap** → Provide clear application implementation steps and phases
4. **Success Metrics** → Define measurable application success criteria and validation approaches
5. **Review Preparation** → Prepare application proposal for user review and potential revision

## Application Proposal Creation Process

### Application Proposals (AxiomTestApp/Proposals/Active/)
**Focus**: Test application development, framework integration validation, user experience implementation
**Directory**: `/Users/tojkuv/Documents/GitHub/Axiom/AxiomTestApp/Proposals/Active/`
**Implementation**: Implemented through ApplicationDevelopment/DEVELOP.md
**Progress Tracking**: Tracked in ApplicationDevelopment/TRACKING.md

## Application Proposal Lifecycle Management

### Application Proposal States
- **Active**: Application proposal created in Active/ directory, ready for user review
- **Under Revision**: User requests changes, application proposal updated in Active/ directory
- **Approved**: User approves application proposal, ready for ApplicationDevelopment/DEVELOP.md implementation
- **In Development**: ApplicationDevelopment/DEVELOP.md implementing proposal, progress tracked in TRACKING.md
- **Completed**: Application implementation complete, proposal archived to Archive/ directory

### Application Workflow Integration
1. **ApplicationDevelopment/@PLAN** → Creates application proposal in AxiomTestApp/Proposals/Active/
2. **User Review** → User reviews and optionally revises application proposal
3. **User Approval** → User approves application proposal for implementation
4. **ApplicationDevelopment/@DEVELOP** → Implements application proposal, tracks progress in TRACKING.md
5. **ApplicationDevelopment/@CHECKPOINT** → Completes application implementation, archives proposal

## Application Planning Command Execution

**Command**: `@PLAN [plan|validate|enhance]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive application planning workflow with proposal creation

**Automated Execution Process**:
1. **Branch Validation** → Ensure current branch is application branch (required for application development)
2. **TRACKING.md Priority Analysis** → Read current priorities and status from ApplicationDevelopment/TRACKING.md
3. **Application Context Analysis** → Analyze existing application implementation and identify development needs
4. **Requirements Assessment** → Understand application development objectives and constraints
5. **Technical Planning** → Design application technical approach and implementation strategy
6. **Application Proposal Creation** → Create structured application proposal in AxiomTestApp/Proposals/Active/
7. **Review Preparation** → Prepare application proposal for user review and potential revision

**Application Planning Execution Examples**:
- `@PLAN` → Create application development proposal
- `@PLAN plan` → Plan application development tasks and create proposal
- `@PLAN validate` → Plan application validation and create testing proposal
- `@PLAN enhance` → Plan application enhancements and user experience improvements

## Application Proposal Format Standards

### Application Proposal Structure
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive application proposal title
- **Summary**: Brief overview of application proposal objectives and approach
- **Technical Specification**: Detailed application technical approach and architecture
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step application implementation phases and procedures
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive application testing approach and validation procedures
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable application outcomes and validation criteria
- **Integration Notes**: Application integration considerations and dependencies

### Application Quality Standards

## Application Planning Workflow Integration

**Planning Purpose**: Strategic application proposal creation for structured development
**Implementation Separation**: ApplicationDevelopment/DEVELOP.md implements proposals, never edits them
**Progress Tracking**: ApplicationDevelopment/TRACKING.md monitors application proposal implementation progress
**Archive Management**: Completed application proposals archived for reference and documentation
**User Control**: Users review, revise, and approve application proposals before implementation

## Application Planning Coordination

**Proposal Creation**: Creates application proposals in AxiomTestApp/Proposals/Active/ directory
**User Interaction**: Application proposals designed for user review, revision, and approval
**Development Integration**: Application proposals implemented through ApplicationDevelopment/DEVELOP.md
**Progress Monitoring**: Application implementation progress tracked through ApplicationDevelopment/TRACKING.md
**Archive Management**: Completed application proposals archived for future reference
