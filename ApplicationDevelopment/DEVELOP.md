3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `application` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `application` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `application` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Application Development Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Application development focuses on building test applications that demonstrate framework capabilities through practical implementation and user experience validation.

**Quality Standards**: Application components maintain framework integration patterns, provide good user experience, and validate framework capabilities through real-world usage.

**Testing Requirements**: Application development targets high test coverage with comprehensive test success rates. See `AxiomTestApp/Documentation/Testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` for testing requirements and standards.

**Development Focus**: Application development implements features that demonstrate framework capabilities through user interfaces, business logic implementation, and integration validation.
