## Application Development Execution Loop

**Command**: `@DEVELOP [plan|build|test|validate]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive application development workflow with methodology enforcement

### 🔄 **Branch Verification and Setup**

**Before executing any development work, execute this branch verification:**

```bash
# 1. Check current branch and switch to application branch if needed
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "🎯 Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "application" ]; then
    echo "🔄 Switching from $CURRENT_BRANCH to application branch..."
    
    # Check if application branch exists
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/application; then
        echo "📍 Application branch exists locally, switching..."
        git checkout application
    elif git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/application; then
        echo "📍 Application branch exists remotely, checking out..."
        git checkout -b application origin/application
    else
        echo "🌱 Creating new application branch..."
        git checkout -b application
        git push origin application -u
    fi
    
    echo "✅ Now on application branch"
else
    echo "✅ Already on application branch"
fi

# 2. Update application branch with latest changes
echo "🔄 Updating application branch..."
git fetch origin application 2>/dev/null || true
git pull origin application 2>/dev/null || echo "📍 No remote updates available"

echo "🎯 Branch verification complete - ready for application development"
```

**Automated Execution Process**:
