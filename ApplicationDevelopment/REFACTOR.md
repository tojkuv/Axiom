### Application Refactoring Scope
**Refactoring Focus**: Application code organization, structural improvements, and technical debt elimination
**Quality Standards**: Structural integrity with zero functionality changes
**Integration**: Integration with @PLAN, @CHECKPOINT, and application development workflows

### 🔄 **Standardized Git Workflow**
All ApplicationDevelopment commands follow this workflow:
1. **Branch Setup**: Switch to `application` branch (create if doesn't exist)
2. **Update**: Pull latest changes from remote `application` branch
3. **Development**: Execute command-specific development work
4. **Commit**: Commit changes to `application` branch with descriptive messages
5. **Integration**: Merge `application` branch into `main` branch
6. **Deployment**: Push `main` branch to remote repository
7. **Cycle Reset**: Delete old `application` branch and create fresh one for next cycle

## Application Refactoring Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Application refactoring improves application code structure, organization, and maintainability without changing functionality, creating a clean foundation that accelerates application development and prevents technical debt accumulation.

**Quality Standards**: Application refactoring operations preserve existing functionality while improving application code organization, reducing complexity, and enhancing maintainability.

**Integrity Requirements**: Application refactoring maintains functionality preservation with zero behavioral changes. See `AxiomTestApp/Documentation/Refactoring/REFACTORING_STRATEGY.md` for refactoring requirements and standards.

**Structural Excellence**: Application refactoring focuses on creating optimal application code organization that supports long-term development velocity and user experience evolution.

## Application Refactoring Principles

### Structural Integrity
- **Functionality Preservation**: Zero behavioral changes during application refactoring operations
- **Framework Integration**: Maintain adherence to framework integration patterns
- **User Experience Stability**: Preserve user interface behavior and interaction patterns
- **Performance Neutrality**: Ensure application refactoring does not degrade performance
- **Framework Pattern Consistency**: Maintain existing framework usage patterns and safety characteristics

### Organization Excellence
- **Application Structure**: Improve file organization, feature structure, and directory hierarchy
- **Component Organization**: Standardize component naming and improve clarity
- **Framework Integration**: Optimize framework usage patterns and integration relationships
- **User Interface Organization**: Ensure UI organization matches user experience structure
- **Pattern Consistency**: Apply consistent application patterns and framework integration approaches

### Technical Debt Elimination
- **Code Duplication**: Identify and eliminate redundant application code through proper abstraction
- **Complexity Reduction**: Simplify complex application structures while maintaining functionality
- **Unused Code Removal**: Remove dead code, unused components, and obsolete application features
- **Standard Compliance**: Ensure application code follows established standards and conventions
- **User Experience Metrics**: Improve maintainability, readability, and application complexity

### Application Refactoring Standards
**Requirements**: Functionality preservation, comprehensive testing validation, structural improvement measurement
**Standards**: See `AxiomTestApp/Documentation/Refactoring/REFACTORING_STRATEGY.md` for detailed refactoring methodology and requirements

## Application Refactoring Methodology

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
1. **Current State Assessment** → Analyze existing application structure and identify improvement opportunities
2. **Refactoring Planning** → Design application structural improvements that align with framework integration goals
3. **Risk Analysis** → Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies
4. **Success Metrics** → Define measurable criteria for application refactoring success
5. **Execution Planning** → Plan application refactoring sequence and dependencies

### Phase 2: Structure and Organization
1. **Application Organization** → Improve application file structure, directory hierarchy, and feature organization
2. **Component Standardization** → Apply consistent naming conventions across application components
3. **Framework Integration Optimization** → Optimize framework usage patterns and integration relationships
4. **Feature Grouping** → Organize related application functionality into cohesive modules
5. **User Interface Alignment** → Ensure interfaces match application architectural intentions

### Phase 3: Quality and Cleanup
**Requirements**: Comprehensive cleanup with functionality preservation
**Cleanup Strategy**: Dead code removal, duplication elimination, complexity reduction, standard compliance
**Standards**: Detailed refactoring requirements in `AxiomTestApp/Documentation/Refactoring/REFACTORING_STRATEGY.md`
**Development Rule**: Any functionality change blocks refactoring progress until corrected

### Phase 4: Validation and Documentation
1. **Functionality Verification** → Validate that all existing application functionality remains intact
2. **Performance Validation** → Ensure application refactoring maintains or improves performance
3. **Documentation Updates** → Update application documentation to reflect structural changes
4. **Integration Testing** → Verify refactored application integrates properly with framework
5. **Quality Review** → Final review to ensure application refactoring meets standards

## Application Refactoring Categories

### Application Structure Refactoring
- **Feature Organization** → Optimal application feature structure and directory hierarchy
- **Component Structure** → Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- **Framework Integration** → Clean framework usage patterns and integration optimization
- **User Interface Grouping** → Logical organization of related UI functionality
- **Navigation Structure** → Clean and consistent navigation structures

### Quality Enhancement Refactoring
- **Complexity Reduction** → Simplify complex application structures while preserving functionality
- **Duplication Elimination** → Remove redundant application code through proper abstraction
- **Component Naming** → Enhance clarity through better naming conventions
- **Standard Compliance** → Ensure adherence to application coding standards and conventions
- **Documentation Alignment** → Align application structure with documentation organization

### Technical Debt Elimination
- **Dead Code Removal** → Remove unused application code, components, and obsolete features
- **Performance Optimization** → Structural improvements that enhance application performance
- **User Experience Optimization** → Optimize user interface patterns and interaction management

## Application Refactoring Execution Loop

**Command**: `@REFACTOR [plan|organize|cleanup|optimize]`
**Action**: Execute comprehensive application refactoring workflow with methodology enforcement

### 🔄 **Branch Verification and Setup**

**Before executing any refactoring work, execute this branch verification:**

```bash
# 1. Check current branch and switch to application branch if needed
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "🎯 Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "application" ]; then
    echo "🔄 Switching from $CURRENT_BRANCH to application branch..."
    
    # Check if application branch exists
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/application; then
        echo "📍 Application branch exists locally, switching..."
        git checkout application
    elif git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/application; then
        echo "📍 Application branch exists remotely, checking out..."
        git checkout -b application origin/application
    else
        echo "🌱 Creating new application branch..."
        git checkout -b application
        git push origin application -u
    fi
    
    echo "✅ Now on application branch"
else
    echo "✅ Already on application branch"
fi

# 2. Update application branch with latest changes
echo "🔄 Updating application branch..."
git fetch origin application 2>/dev/null || true
git pull origin application 2>/dev/null || echo "📍 No remote updates available"

echo "🎯 Branch verification complete - ready for application refactoring"
```

**Automated Execution Process**:
1. **Branch Verification** → Switch to `application` branch and update with latest changes
