# Axiom Framework: Multi-Terminal Strategic Proposal System

**Comprehensive analysis and strategic rethinking with isolated proposal exploration**

## ü§ñ Automated Mode Trigger

**When human sends**: `@PROPOSE`
**Action**: Automatically enter ultrathink mode and analyze current approach for improvement opportunities

**Multi-Terminal Process** (Conflict-Free Exploration):
1. **Verify Main Branch** ‚Üí Ensure working on main branch (Terminal 1 context)
2. **Read PROPOSE.md** ‚Üí Load this complete analysis guide
3. **Analyze Current State** ‚Üí Deep assessment of framework, test app, and roadmap effectiveness
4. **Generate Strategic Proposals** ‚Üí Create isolated proposal files in `/Proposals/` directory
5. **Present to User** ‚Üí Clear proposals with benefits, costs, and implementation approach
6. **Await User Selection** ‚Üí User chooses which proposals to approve via `@APPROVE <proposal-file>`

## üéØ PROPOSE Mode Mission

**Primary Focus**: Strategic analysis and improvement proposal generation for the entire Axiom development ecosystem through isolated exploration.

**Enhanced Responsibility**: PROPOSE.md is the **Strategic Analysis Engine** - generating comprehensive improvement proposals in the `/Proposals/` directory without affecting active development, enabling strategic thinking while Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 work.

**Philosophy**: Revolutionary frameworks require revolutionary thinking. Regularly challenge assumptions, optimize structures, and evolve approaches based on learning and changing requirements. Explore strategic opportunities safely in isolation.

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal 1 (Main Branch) Proposal Context

**Terminal Identity**: Terminal 1 - Main Branch - Strategic Proposal Exploration
**Primary File Scope**: `/Proposals/` directory ONLY - completely isolated from active development
**Terminal Coordination**: Can work while Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 are ACTIVE - no conflicts possible
**Merge Strategy**: Proposals reviewed and approved separately via @APPROVE command

**What Terminal 1 (PROPOSE.md) Works On**:
- ‚úÖ **Strategic Analysis**: Deep assessment of framework, test app, and development processes
- ‚úÖ **Proposal Generation**: Create comprehensive improvement recommendations in `/Proposals/`
- ‚úÖ **Isolated Exploration**: Develop strategic ideas without disrupting active development
- ‚úÖ **Innovation Research**: Explore breakthrough opportunities and revolutionary thinking
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Planning**: Detail how proposals could be executed when approved

**What Terminal 1 (PROPOSE.md) Avoids**:
- ‚ùå **Direct Implementation**: No changes to framework, test app, or roadmap
- ‚ùå **Active Development Interference**: No conflicts with Terminal 2 or Terminal 3 work
- ‚ùå **Immediate Changes**: All proposals require separate approval process

**Proposal Isolation Strategy**:
- **Conflict-Free**: Proposals directory doesn't interfere with framework or test app development
- **Parallel Work**: Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 can work simultaneously without disruption
- **Safe Exploration**: Strategic thinking can happen without affecting active development
- **Controlled Integration**: Proposals only affect roadmap/documentation via @APPROVE command
