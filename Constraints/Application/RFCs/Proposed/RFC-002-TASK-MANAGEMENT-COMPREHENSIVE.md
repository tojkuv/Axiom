# RFC-002: Task Management Comprehensive Test App

**RFC Number**: 002  
**Title**: Task Management Comprehensive Test App  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Type**: Test App  
**Created**: 2025-06-05  
**Updated**: 2025-06-06 (End-to-End Flows implementation completed)  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of all Axiom framework components, patterns, and performance characteristics

## Abstract

This RFC specifies a comprehensive task management application that validates all six Axiom component types, core architectural constraints, navigation patterns, and performance requirements. The app provides task creation, categorization, synchronization, and collaborative features to test complex multi-client coordination, capability integration, error boundaries, and concurrent operations at scale.

The test app exercises the complete framework stack: multiple actor-based Clients with interdependencies, transient Capabilities for system resources, Context observation of multiple Clients, Orchestrator-managed navigation including deep linking, and stress testing with 10,000+ tasks. Through realistic user workflows, it validates that Axiom correctly enforces all architectural constraints while maintaining sub-16ms state propagation and proper memory management under load.

## Motivation

### Framework Testing Goals

This test app comprehensively validates all Axiom architectural patterns:
- All 6 component types working together (Capability, State, Client, Orchestrator, Context, Presentation)
- Client isolation with proper actor boundaries preventing data races
- Context dependencies forming proper DAG without circular references
- Unidirectional data flow from Orchestrator → Context → Client → Capability
- Navigation architecture including stack, modal, and tab patterns with cancellation
- Error boundary propagation from Capabilities through Clients to Contexts
- Concurrent operations with proper task cancellation and priority handling
- Performance under stress with 10,000+ tasks and 100+ concurrent operations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Multi-Client Coordination**: TaskClient, UserClient, and SyncClient interact through proper channels
2. **Capability Integration**: Network, Storage, and Notification capabilities with failure scenarios
3. **Complex Navigation**: Tab-based main UI with modal creation flows and deep task details
4. **Concurrent Sync**: Background sync while user performs CRUD operations tests actor reentrancy
5. **Error Recovery**: Network failures, storage corruption, and permission denials test error boundaries
6. **Performance Limits**: 10,000 tasks with real-time search and filtering validates state propagation
7. **Memory Pressure**: Rapid Context creation/destruction with large datasets tests for leaks
8. **Deep Linking**: URL-based navigation to specific tasks tests route resolution
