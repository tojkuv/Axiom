# CODEBASE-ANALYSIS-ACTOR-PROTOCOL

Post-development comprehensive codebase analysis protocol for technical assessment, competitive positioning, and maturity evaluation. Operates on final stabilized codebase to provide comprehensive technical insights.

## Protocol Activation

```
@CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_ACTOR execute <source_directory> <analyses_directory> <analysis_template>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<source_directory>`: Directory containing the final codebase to analyze
- `<analyses_directory>`: Directory containing previous analysis artifacts
- `<analysis_template>`: Path to the analysis actor template for structuring assessment

**Prerequisites:**
- Final codebase must be available in `<source_directory>/` (typically the stabilized result)
- Previous analysis artifacts should be available in `<analyses_directory>/` (if any)

**Explicit Input/Output Structure:**
- **INPUT**: `<source_directory>/` - Final codebase to analyze (READ-ONLY)
- **INPUT**: `<analyses_directory>/` - Previous analysis artifacts for context (READ-ONLY)  
- **OUTPUT**: `<analyses_directory>/CODEBASE-ANALYSIS-*.md` - Generated analysis artifact

## Command

### Execute - Codebase Analysis

The execute command performs comprehensive technical analysis of the codebase:
- Analyzes codebase for technical quality and architecture
- Identifies improvement opportunities
- Assesses competitive positioning and maturity
- Generates comprehensive analysis artifacts

```bash
@CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_ACTOR execute \
  /path/to/final-codebase \
  /path/to/analyses \
  /path/to/codebase-analysis-actor-template.md
```

## Analysis Integration Process

### Phase 1: Final Codebase Analysis

**Comprehensive Code Content Analysis:**
```bash
analyze_final_codebase_state(source_directory) {
    SOURCE_FILES = find_all_source_files(source_directory)
    CONFIG_FILES = find_configuration_files(source_directory)
    TEST_FILES = find_test_files(source_directory)
    BUILD_FILES = find_build_files(source_directory)
    
    for file in ALL_FILES:
        CONTENT[file] = read_file_content(file)
        APIS[file] = extract_public_apis(CONTENT[file])
        DEPENDENCIES[file] = extract_dependencies(CONTENT[file])
        PATTERNS[file] = identify_code_patterns(CONTENT[file])
        COMPLEXITY[file] = calculate_complexity_metrics(CONTENT[file])
    done
    
    FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT = synthesize_codebase_state(
        CONTENT, APIS, DEPENDENCIES, PATTERNS, COMPLEXITY
    )
}
```

### Phase 2: Technical Assessment

**Comprehensive Technical Analysis:**
```bash
assess_technical_foundations(FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT) {
    ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS = analyze_final_architecture(
        FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.architecture
    )
    
    CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT = assess_delivered_capabilities(
        FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.capabilities
    )
    
    QUALITY_EVALUATION = evaluate_final_quality(
        FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.quality
    )
    
    TECHNICAL_FOUNDATIONS = synthesize_technical_assessment(
        ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS, CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT, QUALITY_EVALUATION
    )
}
```

### Phase 3: Competitive Analysis

**Competitive Positioning Assessment:**
```bash
analyze_competitive_position(FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT) {
    COMPETITORS = identify_primary_competitors(FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.codebase_type)
    
    for competitor in COMPETITORS:
        COMPETITIVE_COMPARISON[competitor] = compare_capabilities(
            competitor,
            FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.capabilities,
            FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.technical_approach
        )
    done
    
    COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGES = identify_delivered_advantages(
        COMPETITIVE_COMPARISON, FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.unique_solutions
    )
}
```

### Phase 4: Maturity Assessment

**Maturity Evaluation:**
```bash
assess_codebase_maturity(FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT) {
    MATURITY_STANDARDS = define_maturity_standards_for_codebase_type(
        FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.codebase_type
    )
    
    CURRENT_MATURITY = evaluate_current_maturity_state(
        FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT
    )
    
    MATURITY_GAPS = identify_maturity_gaps(
        CURRENT_MATURITY, MATURITY_STANDARDS
    )
    
    MATURITY_ROADMAP = create_advancement_path(
        MATURITY_GAPS, FINAL_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.successful_patterns
    )
}
```

## Analysis Artifact Generation

### Comprehensive Analysis Document Creation

```bash
generate_comprehensive_analysis(analyses_directory, analysis_template) {
    # Create analysis artifact in analyses directory
    timestamp = generate_timestamp() # YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
    analysis_id = "COMPREHENSIVE-${timestamp}"
    
    # Create comprehensive analysis artifact
    artifact_file = "${analyses_directory}/CODEBASE-ANALYSIS-${analysis_id}.md"
    
    populate_analysis_template(
        analysis_template, 
        artifact_file, 
        COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS_RESULTS
    )
}
```

## EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM ANALYSIS (MVP FOCUS)

This analysis deliberately excludes all MVP-incompatible concerns:
- Version control strategies and migration approaches (focus on final delivered state)
- Database versioning and schema migration analysis (work with final delivered schema)
- Deprecation management (analysis focuses on delivered solutions)
- Legacy code preservation (analysis focuses on final transformed state)
- Backward compatibility analysis (focus on current delivered capabilities)
- Semantic versioning considerations (MVP operates on final iteration)
- API stability preservation (APIs evolved for MVP optimization in final state)
- Configuration migration strategies (use final delivered configuration)
- Deployment versioning (deploy final delivered state)
- Release management (continuous MVP iteration approach)
- Rollback procedures (no rollback concerns for MVP)
