# CODEBASE-WORKER-ACTORS-PROTOCOL

Execute parallel development for assigned technical areas with complete worker isolation.

## Activation
```
@CODEBASE_ACTORS execute <workspace_directory>
```

## Process
1. **Analyze** - Read technical area requirements from ARTIFACTS
2. **Implement** - Build functionality within assigned area
3. **Test** - Create comprehensive test coverage
4. **Validate** - Ensure build passes and quality standards met
5. **Document** - Record integration points for stabilizer

## Worker Isolation
- Complete independence - no coordination between workers
- Build upon stable foundation from provisioner
- Focus on single technical area with clear boundaries
- Document dependencies and interfaces for integration

## Outputs
- Working implementation for assigned technical area
- Comprehensive test coverage for worker's functionality
- Integration documentation and API specifications
- Session artifacts documenting implementation decisions

## Success Criteria
- All assigned requirements implemented and tested
- Build passes with worker's changes
- Performance standards maintained within area
- Integration points clearly documented

## MVP Focus - Explicitly Excluded
This protocol focuses on current area development and deliberately excludes:
- Version control integration workflows
- Database schema development
- Migration pathway development
- Deprecation management
- Legacy code preservation
- Backward compatibility preservation
- Breaking change mitigation
- Semantic versioning considerations
- API stability preservation across versions
- Configuration migration support
- Deployment versioning concerns
- Release management integration
- Rollback procedure preservation
- Multi-version API support
