## Worker-Isolated TDD Development Log

### RED Phase - [Feature/API or Refactoring Target]

**IMPLEMENTATION Test Written**: Validates solution addresses pain point
```[language]

    let manager = StateManager()
    await manager.performNewCapability()
    assert(manager.painPointResolved)
}
```

**REFACTORING Test Written**: Preserves current behavior
```[language]
// Behavior preservation test for worker's code
[test_function_declaration] testCurrentBehaviorPreserved() async throws {
    // Test ensuring worker's refactoring preserves functionality
    let result = existingAPI.performOperation()
    assertEqual(result, expectedBehavior)
}
```

    func updateB() { /* 15 lines duplicate logic */ }
    func updateC() { /* 15 lines duplicate logic */ }

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT (MVP FOCUS):**
This parallel development deliberately excludes all MVP-incompatible concerns:
- Version control integration development (focus on current codebase state)
- Database versioning considerations (work with current schema)
- Migration pathway development (no migration concerns for MVP)
- Deprecation management development (we fix problems, don't deprecate)
- Legacy code preservation development (transform code, don't preserve)
- Backward compatibility constraints (no compatibility limitations)
- Breaking change mitigation (breaking changes welcomed for MVP clarity)
- Semantic versioning enforcement (MVP operates on current iteration)
- API stability preservation across versions (APIs evolve for MVP optimization)
- Configuration migration support (use current configuration)
- Deployment versioning concerns (deploy current state)
- Release management integration (continuous MVP iteration)
- Rollback procedure development (no rollback concerns for MVP)
- Multi-version support development (single current version)
