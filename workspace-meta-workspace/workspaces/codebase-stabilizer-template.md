**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM STABILIZATION (MVP FOCUS):**
This stabilization deliberately excludes all MVP-incompatible concerns:
- Version control integration stabilization (focus on current codebase state)
- Database versioning stabilization (work with current schema)
- Migration pathway stabilization (no migration concerns for MVP)
- Deprecation management stabilization (we fix problems, don't deprecate)
- Legacy code compatibility stabilization (transform code, don't preserve)
- Backward compatibility preservation (no compatibility constraints)
- Breaking change mitigation (breaking changes welcomed for MVP clarity)
- Semantic versioning enforcement (MVP operates on current iteration)
- API stability preservation across versions (APIs evolve for MVP optimization)
- Configuration migration support (use current configuration)
- Deployment versioning concerns (deploy current state)
- Release management integration (continuous MVP iteration)
- Rollback procedure stabilization (no rollback concerns for MVP)
- Multi-version API support (single current API version)

### Application Readiness
This stabilization session has transformed the parallel-developed codebase into a coherent, stable, application-ready platform. All integration conflicts resolved, current APIs optimized, and performance enhanced for MVP application development.
