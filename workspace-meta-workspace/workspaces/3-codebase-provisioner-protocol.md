# CODEBASE-PROVISIONER-PROTOCOL

Establish foundational infrastructure for parallel development with zero-defect foundation.

## Activation
```
@CODEBASE_PROVISIONER execute <workspace_directory>
```

## Process
1. **Analyze** - Read foundational requirements from ARTIFACTS
2. **Implement** - Build critical infrastructure and core patterns
3. **Test** - Create comprehensive test coverage and validation
4. **Validate** - Ensure zero build errors and test failures
5. **Document** - Record architectural decisions for workers

## Infrastructure Areas
- **Build System** - Compilation, testing, dependency management
- **Core APIs** - Foundational interfaces and shared components
- **Testing Framework** - Test utilities and patterns
- **Development Tools** - Code quality and automation tools

## Outputs
- Stable project foundation ready for parallel development
- Core APIs and shared components implemented
- Testing framework and development tools configured
- Integration documentation for workers

## Success Criteria
- Foundation supports all planned technical areas
- Build system works reliably across configurations
- Testing framework enables effective development
- Clear integration points defined for workers

## MVP Focus - Explicitly Excluded
This protocol focuses on current foundation infrastructure and deliberately excludes:
- Version control integration setup
- Database schema infrastructure
- Migration pathway infrastructure
- Deprecation management infrastructure
- Legacy code preservation infrastructure
- Backward compatibility infrastructure
- Breaking change mitigation infrastructure
- Semantic versioning infrastructure
- API stability preservation across versions
- Configuration migration infrastructure
- Deployment versioning infrastructure
- Release management infrastructure
- Rollback procedure infrastructure
- Multi-version API support infrastructure
