# CODEBASE-STABILIZER-PROTOCOL

Integrate parallel worker results into stable, application-ready codebase.

## Activation
```
@CODEBASE_STABILIZER execute <workspace_directory>
```

## Process
1. **Assess** - Analyze codebase type and integration conflicts
2. **Stabilize** - Fix compilation errors and structural issues
3. **Integrate** - Resolve cross-worker conflicts and unify implementations
4. **Optimize** - Apply performance improvements and type-specific enhancements
5. **Validate** - Verify build, tests, and application readiness

## Priority Levels
- **Critical** - Compilation fixes, integration conflicts, API conflicts
- **High** - Pattern unification, dependency conflicts, structural issues
- **Medium** - Code health, performance optimization, documentation

## Outputs
- Unified codebase with zero integration conflicts
- Stable API contracts across components
- Performance-validated implementation
- Application-ready deliverable

## Success Criteria
- All parallel work integrates successfully
- Codebase builds and tests pass
- Performance meets baseline requirements

## MVP Focus - Explicitly Excluded
This protocol focuses on current state integration and deliberately excludes:
- Version control integration concerns
- Database schema integration
- Migration pathway integration
- Deprecation management during integration
- Legacy code preservation during integration
- Backward compatibility preservation
- Breaking change mitigation
- Semantic versioning enforcement
- API stability preservation across versions
- Configuration migration support
- Deployment versioning concerns
- Release management integration
- Rollback procedure preservation
- Multi-version API support
