## Foundational TDD Development Log

### RED Phase - [Foundational Feature/API]

**Test Written**: Validates foundational capability
```[language]
// Test for foundational infrastructure
[test_function_declaration] {

    // Verify foundation ready for parallel actors
    assert(foundation.coreInfrastructure != null)
}
```

    public init() {
        // Establish foundation for all parallel work
        this.coreInfrastructure = CoreInfrastructure()
    }
    
    public var isProperlyInitialized: Bool {
        return coreInfrastructure.isReady
    }

        return coreInfrastructure.infrastructure
    }
}

### Foundation Session Storage

This session artifact stored in: PROVISIONER/CB-PROVISIONER-SESSION-XXX.md
Part of foundation establishment sequence before parallel actor work begins.

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM FOUNDATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MVP FOCUS):**
This foundational development deliberately excludes all MVP-incompatible concerns:
- Version control integration foundation (focus on current codebase state)
- Database versioning foundation (work with current schema)
- Migration pathway foundation (no migration concerns for MVP)
- Deprecation management infrastructure (we fix problems, don't deprecate)
- Legacy code support infrastructure (transform code, don't preserve)
- Backward compatibility foundation (no compatibility constraints)
- Breaking change mitigation (breaking changes welcomed for MVP clarity)
- Semantic versioning infrastructure (MVP operates on current iteration)
- API stability preservation systems (APIs evolve for MVP optimization)
- Configuration migration infrastructure (use current configuration)
- Deployment versioning foundation (deploy current state)
- Release management infrastructure (continuous MVP iteration)
- Rollback procedure foundation (no rollback concerns for MVP)
- Multi-version support infrastructure (single current version)
