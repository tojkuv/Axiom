## Codebase Usage Examples

### Basic Application Integration
```[language]
// Getting started example for application developers
import [CodebaseName]

// Platform-specific application structure
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    private let codebaseManager = CodebaseManager()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .task {
                    await codebaseManager.initialize(
                        configuration: .default
                    )
                }
        }
    }
}
```

### Common Usage Patterns
```[language]
// Typical application usage patterns
class ApplicationViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private let stateManager: StateManager
    private let navigationController: NavigationController
    
    func performCommonTask() async {
        // Pattern application developers use frequently
        try await stateManager.updateState(\.status, to: .loading)
        let result = await codebaseManager.performOperation()
        try await stateManager.updateState(\.result, to: result)
    }
}
```

### Testing Integration
```[language]
// How applications test codebase usage
class ApplicationTests: XCTestCase {
    func testCodebaseIntegration() async throws {
        // Testing pattern for application developers
        let testManager = CodebaseTestUtilities.createTestManager()
        let result = try await testManager.performOperation()
        assertEqual(result.status, .success)
    }
}
```

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM DOCUMENTATION (MVP FOCUS):**
This documentation deliberately excludes all MVP-incompatible concerns:
- Version control integration documentation (focus on current state)
- API versioning and migration guides (document current APIs only)
- Deprecation notices and warnings (we fix problems, don't deprecate)
- Legacy usage pattern documentation (document current patterns only)
- Backward compatibility notes (no compatibility constraints)
- Breaking change documentation (breaking changes welcomed)
- Semantic versioning references (MVP operates on current iteration)
- Multi-version API documentation (single current API version)
- Configuration migration guides (use current configuration)
- Deployment versioning procedures (deploy current state)
- Release history documentation (focus on current capabilities)
- Rollback procedure documentation (no rollback concerns for MVP)

### Documentation Maintenance
1. [How documentation should evolve with current codebase state]
2. [Process for keeping examples current and accurate]
3. [Method for incorporating application developer feedback]
4. [Strategy for documenting current codebase capabilities]
