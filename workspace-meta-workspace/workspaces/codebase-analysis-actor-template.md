**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM ANALYSIS (MVP FOCUS):**
This analysis deliberately excludes all MVP-incompatible concerns:
- Version control strategies and migration pathways (focus on current development-achieved state)
- Database versioning and migration analysis (work with current development-delivered schema)
- Deprecation management assessment (development process fixed problems, didn't deprecate)
- Legacy code preservation evaluation (development process transformed code, didn't preserve)
- Backward compatibility analysis (no compatibility constraints in development)
- Breaking change impact assessment (development welcomed breaking changes for clarity)
- Semantic versioning considerations (MVP development operates on current iteration)
- API stability preservation (APIs evolved for MVP optimization during development)
- Configuration migration analysis (use current development-delivered configuration)
- Deployment versioning assessment (deploy current development-achieved state)
- Release management evaluation (continuous MVP iteration through development)
- Rollback procedure analysis (no rollback concerns for MVP development)

**Development-Informed Comprehensive Focus**: This assessment represents a comprehensive post-development analysis integrating final codebase state with complete development journey. The analysis maintains technical grounding through deep code examination combined with development artifact analysis, providing comprehensive insights based on actual development work performed and outcomes achieved.
