**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM ANALYSIS (MVP FOCUS):**
This analysis deliberately excludes all MVP-incompatible concerns:
- Version control strategies and history (focus on current state)
- Database versioning and migration analysis (work with current schema)
- Deprecation management assessment (we fix problems, don't deprecate)
- Legacy code preservation evaluation (transform code, don't preserve)
- Backward compatibility analysis (no compatibility constraints)
- Breaking change impact assessment (breaking changes welcomed)
- Semantic versioning considerations (MVP operates on current iteration)
- API stability preservation (APIs evolve for MVP optimization)
- Configuration migration analysis (use current configuration)
- Deployment versioning assessment (deploy current state)
- Release management evaluation (continuous MVP iteration)
- Rollback procedure analysis (no rollback concerns for MVP)

**Actor Specialization Focus**: This assessment represents a [SPECIALIZATION]-focused perspective requiring cross-actor confirmation for critical findings. The analysis maintains technical grounding through deep code examination while providing specialized insights that complement other actor perspectives for comprehensive codebase understanding.
