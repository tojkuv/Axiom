# CODEBASE-STABILIZER-PROTOCOL

Execute comprehensive stabilization cycles after parallel TDD actors complete their work. Single stabilizer worker operates on isolated stabilizer folder requirements, processing codebase changes from PROVISIONER and all [2-8] parallel WORKER folders by accessing their session artifacts to produce application-ready stable codebase. Ensures zero integration conflicts, stable API contracts, and validated performance baselines.

## Stabilization Requirements Focus

**Integration Requirements:**
- Cross-worker component integration
- Conflict resolution between parallel developments
- Pattern consistency across codebase
- Dependency resolution and optimization
- Integration test coverage establishment

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM STABILIZATION (MVP FOCUS):**
- Version control integration (stabilization focuses on current codebase state)
- Database versioning stabilization (work with current schema)
- Migration pathway stabilization (no migration concerns for MVP)
- Deprecation management (we fix problems, don't deprecate)
- Legacy code compatibility (transform code, don't preserve obsolete patterns)
- Backward compatibility preservation (no compatibility constraints)
- Breaking change mitigation (breaking changes welcomed for MVP clarity)
- Semantic versioning enforcement (MVP operates on current iteration)
- API stability preservation across versions (APIs evolve for MVP optimization)
- Configuration migration support (use current configuration)
- Deployment versioning concerns (deploy current state)
- Release management integration (continuous MVP iteration)
- Rollback procedures (no rollback concerns for MVP)
- Multi-version API support (single current API version)

**API Stabilization Requirements:**
- Public API contract validation (current state)
- API consistency enforcement (within current codebase)
- Current API optimization (not preservation)
- API documentation completeness (current capabilities)
- Usage pattern validation (current patterns)

**Application Readiness Requirements:**
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Developer experience validation
- Codebase usability testing
- Documentation and examples
- Production readiness verification

- **Conflict Identification**: Identify conflicting implementations between workers
- **API Surface Mapping**: Map all public APIs from parallel work
- **Integration Planning**: Plan integration approach and conflict resolution

**Per-Requirement Analysis (for current stabilization scope):**

**For Integration Requirements:**
- **Cross-Worker Conflicts**: Extract conflicts that need resolution
- **Integration Points**: Design minimal integration solutions
- **Integration Success Criteria**: Focus on essential integration validation
- **Integration Testing**: Test cross-worker interactions comprehensively

**For Stabilization Requirements:**
- **API Stabilization**: Target and stabilize inconsistent APIs
- **Performance Stabilization**: Preserve worker performance while integrating
- **Pattern Stabilization**: Unify patterns across parallel work
- **Application Readiness**: Test that stabilization enables application development

### 3. TDD Stabilization Cycle Execution

#### RED Phase Execution

**Integration Example:**
```
Starting RED Phase for Cross-Worker Integration...

Writing integration test in Tests/Integration/CrossWorkerTests.[ext]:
[test_function_declaration] testWorker1Worker2Integration() async throws {
    let worker1Feature = Worker1StateManager()
    let worker2Feature = Worker2NavigationService()
    
    // Integration requirement: both features work together
    let app = ApplicationContainer(state: worker1Feature, navigation: worker2Feature)
    assert(app.functionsCorrectly)
}

Quality Validation Checkpoint:
Running build...
✓ Build integrity maintained after integration test addition

Running test...
✗ Test failed as expected: Integration conflict between workers

Coverage Analysis:
✓ Integration test added to coverage tracking
✓ Cross-worker coverage baseline established

Session file updated with integration RED phase progress and quality metrics
```

#### GREEN Phase Execution

**Integration Example:**
```
Starting GREEN Phase...

Implementing integration solution in Sources/Integration/WorkerIntegration.[ext]:
public class WorkerIntegrationLayer {
    private let stateManager: Worker1StateManager
    private let navigationService: Worker2NavigationService
    
    public init(state: Worker1StateManager, navigation: Worker2NavigationService) {
        self.stateManager = state
        self.navigationService = navigation
        
        // Resolve specific conflict: state persistence vs navigation state
        resolveStateNavigationConflict()
    }
    
    private func resolveStateNavigationConflict() {
        // Integration logic that makes worker implementations coherent
        navigationService.setStateProvider(stateManager.stateProvider)
    }
}

protocol ApplicationReadyCodebase {
    func createApplicationContainer() -> ApplicationContainer
}

extension WorkerIntegrationLayer: ApplicationReadyCodebase {
    public func createApplicationContainer() -> ApplicationContainer {
        // Clean, unified interface for application developers
        return ApplicationContainer(
            stateManager: self.stateManager,
            navigationService: self.navigationService,
            integrationLayer: self
        )
    }
}

Comprehensive Quality Validation:
