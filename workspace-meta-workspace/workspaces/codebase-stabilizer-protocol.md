# CODEBASE-STABILIZER-PROTOCOL

Execute comprehensive stabilization cycles after parallel worker development completes. Single stabilizer worker operates on isolated stabilizer folder, processing codebase changes from PROVISIONER and all [2-8] parallel WORKER folders by accessing their session artifacts to produce application-ready stable codebase. Dynamically assesses codebase type and identifies stabilization opportunities to ensure zero integration conflicts, stable API contracts, and validated performance baselines.

        self.stateManager = state
        self.navigationService = navigation
        
        // Resolve API naming conflicts and ensure compatibility
        resolveAPIConflicts()
    }
    
    private func resolveAPIConflicts() {
        // Unify conflicting API patterns from parallel development
        navigationService.setStateProvider(stateManager.stateProvider)

**Explicit Workspace Usage:**
- `<provisioner_directory>/CODEBASE/`: Foundation codebase (READ-ONLY, inherited as integration baseline)
- `<workers_directory>/WORKER-XX/CODEBASE/`: Worker changes (READ-ONLY, integrated sequentially)
- `<workers_directory>/WORKER-XX/ARTIFACTS/`: Worker session artifacts (READ-ONLY, for integration analysis)
- `<stabilizer_directory>/CODEBASE/`: Final integrated codebase (stabilizer development workspace)
- `<stabilizer_directory>/ARTIFACTS/`: Stabilizer session artifacts and progress tracking

This protocol transforms the parallel-developed codebase into a stable, application-ready platform through systematic integration, validation, and optimization using explicit workspace directories.
