# REQUIREMENTS-W-03-001: Context Lifecycle Coordination

## Overview
Define requirements for context lifecycle management with MainActor coordination, building on PROVISIONER infrastructure for UI synchronization.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Context Lifecycle Protocol
- **Managed Context Interface**
  - Protocol for framework-managed contexts
  - Unique identifier support for context tracking
  - Lifecycle hooks: attached() and detached()
  - MainActor isolation for UI safety

### 2. Context Provider System
- **Centralized Management**
  - Thread-safe context storage with NSLock
  - Get-or-create pattern for context reuse
  - Automatic lifecycle method invocation
  - Memory-efficient weak reference support
  
### 3. SwiftUI Integration
- **ManagedContextView**
  - Automatic context lifecycle binding to view appearance
  - Environment object integration
  - State preservation across view updates
  - Clean detachment on view disappearance

### 4. Dependency Injection
- **Context Container**
  - Global singleton for app-wide contexts
  - Type-safe registration and resolution
  - Property wrapper support (@InjectedContext)
  - KeyPath-based access patterns

### 5. Lazy Context Creation
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Deferred context instantiation
  - Observable wrapper for SwiftUI compatibility
  - Reset capability for testing
  - Creation status tracking

### 6. List Context Pattern
- **Collection Management**
  - Protocol for list item contexts
  - Parent-child relationship support
  - Automatic cleanup of detached items
  - Efficient context reuse for identifiable items

## Technical Specifications

### Context Lifecycle States
```
Not Created -> Creating -> Attached -> Active -> Detaching -> Detached
```

### Memory Management
- Weak references for preventing retain cycles
- Automatic cleanup of detached contexts
- Memory leak detection utilities for testing
- Child context cleanup helpers

### Thread Safety
- MainActor isolation for UI contexts
- NSLock for concurrent access protection
- Async-safe lifecycle transitions
- Race condition prevention

## Integration Points

### With PROVISIONER
- Builds on Core Protocol Foundation (P-001)
- Uses Logging Infrastructure (P-003)
- Integrates with Base Testing (P-005)

### With Other WORKERS
- Coordinates with State Management (WORKER-01)
- Respects Concurrency Safety (WORKER-02)
- Separate from Navigation (WORKER-04)

## Performance Requirements
- Context creation: < 1ms
- Lifecycle transitions: < 0.1ms
- Memory overhead: < 1KB per context
- No retain cycles or memory leaks

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for lifecycle transitions
- Integration tests with SwiftUI
- Memory leak detection tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Concurrent access tests

## Example Usage Pattern
```swift
@MainActor
class MyContext: ObservableContext, ManagedContext {
    nonisolated let id = "my-context"
    
    func attached() {
        // Setup logic
    }
    
    func detached() {
        // Cleanup logic
    }
}

// In SwiftUI
struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        content
            .managedContext(id: "my-context") {
                MyContext()
            }
    }
}
```
