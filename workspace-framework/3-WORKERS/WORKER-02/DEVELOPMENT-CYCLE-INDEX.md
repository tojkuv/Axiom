## Worker-02 Scope and Boundaries

### Domain Responsibility
WORKER-02 is responsible for **Concurrency & Actor Safety Domain** including:
- Actor isolation patterns and safety guarantees
- Structured concurrency coordination frameworks  
- Task cancellation and priority handling
- Deadlock prevention and detection systems
- Client isolation rule enforcement

### Integration Points for Stabilizer
- **Actor Safety Contracts**: Isolation protocols for integration with other workers
- **Concurrency Primitives**: Task coordination patterns for framework-wide use
- **Error Propagation**: Concurrency error handling integration with W-06 (Error Handling)
- **Performance Baselines**: Concurrency overhead metrics for optimization
- **Client Communication**: Isolation-compliant patterns for cross-component interaction

### Success Criteria
- **Zero Data Races**: Stress testing shows no race conditions in actor code
- **10ms Cancellation**: All task cancellation completes within required window
- **Resource Safety**: No deadlocks in resource acquisition patterns
- **Client Isolation**: Compile-time and runtime enforcement prevents coupling
- **Performance Targets**: < 1μs overhead for actor calls, < 10μs cross-actor communication

## Development Notes
- All development isolated to WORKER-02 folder with no awareness of other parallel workers
- Each requirement builds foundational safety that subsequent phases depend on
- Focus on MVP delivery with breaking changes welcomed for simplicity
- Integration documentation captured for stabilizer coordination phase
- Quality validation within worker scope only throughout development
