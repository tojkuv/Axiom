Integration Points Documented: [To be documented] Route validation integration changes for stabilizer
Worker Isolation: Complete isolation maintained - no awareness of other parallel workers

## Issues Being Addressed

### ROUTE-VALIDATION-001: No Compile-Time Route Safety
**Original Report**: Current TypeSafeRoute system lacks build-time validation for route integrity
**Time Wasted**: Estimated 4+ hours per development cycle for manual route debugging and validation
**Current Workaround Complexity**: HIGH - Manual verification of route consistency and parameter matching
**Target Improvement**: Implement comprehensive compile-time route validation with build-time guarantees

### ROUTE-VALIDATION-002: Missing Navigation Graph Analysis
**Original Report**: No detection of navigation cycles, unreachable routes, or invalid transitions
**Time Wasted**: 3+ hours per session for debugging navigation flow issues
**Current Workaround Complexity**: MEDIUM - Runtime debugging without build-time analysis
**Target Improvement**: Built-in navigation graph analysis with cycle detection and reachability validation

// Test written for worker's specific requirement: route compilation validation
func testRouteValidationFramework() throws {
    // This test should fail initially as validation system doesn't exist
    let validator = RouteValidator()
    
    // Test route definition validation
    validator.addRoute(RouteDefinition(
        identifier: "profile",
        path: "/profile/:userId",
        parameters: [.required("userId", String.self)],
        presentation: .push
    ))
    
    validator.addRoute(RouteDefinition(
        identifier: "settings", 
        path: "/settings",
        parameters: [],
        presentation: .present(.sheet)
    ))
    
    // Verify route compilation
    let compilationResult = validator.compile()
    XCTAssertTrue(compilationResult.isSuccess)
    XCTAssertEqual(validator.routeCount, 2)
}

func testNavigationGraphValidation() throws {
    let graphValidator = NavigationGraphValidator()
    
    // Add navigation edges
    graphValidator.addEdge(from: "home", to: "profile")
    graphValidator.addEdge(from: "profile", to: "settings")
    graphValidator.addEdge(from: "settings", to: "home")
    
    // Test cycle detection
    let cycles = graphValidator.detectCycles()
    XCTAssertTrue(cycles.contains(["home", "profile", "settings", "home"]))
    
    // Test reachability analysis
    let unreachable = graphValidator.findUnreachable(from: "home")
    XCTAssertTrue(unreachable.isEmpty)
}

func testRouteParameterValidation() throws {
    let paramValidator = RouteParameterValidator()
    
    // Test required parameter validation
    let validRoute = RouteDefinition(
        identifier: "userProfile",
        path: "/user/:id",
        parameters: [.required("id", String.self)],
        presentation: .push
    )
    XCTAssertTrue(paramValidator.validate(validRoute))
    
    // Test optional parameter validation  
    let optionalRoute = RouteDefinition(
        identifier: "postDetail",
        path: "/post/:id/comment/:commentId?",
        parameters: [
            .required("id", String.self),
            .optional("commentId", String.self)
        ],
        presentation: .push
    )
