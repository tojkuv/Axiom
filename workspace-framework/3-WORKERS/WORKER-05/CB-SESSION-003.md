**Performance Characteristics**:
- Memory operations: <1ms for small objects
- UserDefaults operations: ~2-5ms for preferences
- File operations: ~5-10ms with atomic writes
- Keychain operations: ~10-20ms for secure storage
- Batch operations: 50-80% faster than individual saves

**Security Implementation**:
- Keychain integration with device-locked access control
- Automatic encryption for file storage via iOS data protection
