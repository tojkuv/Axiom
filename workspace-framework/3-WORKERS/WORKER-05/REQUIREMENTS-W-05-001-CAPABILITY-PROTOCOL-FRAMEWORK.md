# REQUIREMENTS-W-05-001: Capability Protocol Framework

## Overview
Design and implement a comprehensive capability protocol framework that provides thread-safe, lifecycle-managed interfaces to external systems. This framework establishes the foundation for all external system interactions with compile-time safety, actor-based isolation, and standardized lifecycle management.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Core Capability Protocol
- **Actor-Based Architecture**:
  - All capabilities must be implemented as actors for thread-safety
  - Automatic isolation boundary enforcement
  - Prevention of data races in external system access
  - Support for concurrent capability operations

- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - Standardized activation/deactivation methods
  - State transitions must complete within 10ms
  - Resource cleanup guarantees
  - Error recovery mechanisms

### 2. Capability State System
- **State Enumeration**:
  - `available`: Ready for use with all resources allocated
  - `unavailable`: Not available due to missing hardware/permissions
  - `restricted`: Limited by system policies or user settings
  - `unknown`: State being determined or transitioning

- **State Observation**:
  - AsyncStream-based state change notifications
  - Real-time state monitoring capabilities
  - State transition history tracking
  - Deterministic state machine behavior

### 3. Extended Capability Protocol
- **Enhanced Lifecycle Features**:
  - Permission request management
  - Platform support detection
  - Resource availability checking
  - Graceful degradation support

- **Timeout Management**:
  - Configurable activation timeouts
  - Default 10ms transition timeout
  - Automatic timeout error handling
  - Retry mechanisms for transient failures

### 4. Capability Manager
- **Centralized Management**:
  - Registration and discovery of capabilities
  - Dependency order initialization
  - Reverse-order termination
  - Capability lifecycle orchestration

- **Resource Coordination**:
  - Prevent resource conflicts
  - Manage shared resources
  - Priority-based allocation
  - Resource usage monitoring

### 5. Standard Capability Implementation
- **Base Implementation**:
  - Reusable `StandardCapability` actor
  - Common state management logic
  - Built-in state stream support
  - Template method pattern for customization

## Technical Implementation

### Protocol Definitions
```swift
public protocol Capability: Actor {
    var isAvailable: Bool { get async }
    func activate() async throws
    func deactivate() async
}

public protocol ExtendedCapability: Capability {
    var state: CapabilityState { get async }
    var stateStream: AsyncStream<CapabilityState> { get async }
    func isSupported() async -> Bool
    func requestPermission() async throws
}
```

### State Management Example
```swift
public actor StandardCapability: Capability, Lifecycle {
    private(set) var state: CapabilityState = .unknown
    private var stateStreamContinuation: AsyncStream<CapabilityState>.Continuation?
    
    public var stateStream: AsyncStream<CapabilityState> {
        AsyncStream { continuation in
            Task {
                await setStreamContinuation(continuation)
                continuation.yield(await state)
            }
        }
    }
    
    public func transitionTo(_ newState: CapabilityState) async {
        guard state != newState else { return }
        state = newState
        stateStreamContinuation?.yield(newState)
    }
}
```

### Manager Implementation
```swift
public actor DefaultCapabilityManager: CapabilityManager {
    private var capabilities: [String: any Capability] = [:]
    private var initializationOrder: [String] = []
    
    public func register<T: Capability>(_ capability: T, for key: String) async {
        capabilities[key] = capability
        initializationOrder.append(key)
    }
    
    public func initializeAll() async {
        for key in initializationOrder {
            if let capability = capabilities[key] {
                try? await capability.activate()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration Points

### Error Handling
- Integration with AxiomError hierarchy
- Specific `CapabilityError` cases:
  - `notAvailable`: Hardware/feature not present
  - `initializationFailed`: Setup errors
  - `permissionDenied`: User denied access
  - `resourceAllocationFailed`: Insufficient resources

### Performance Monitoring
```swift
public func measureCapabilityOperation<T>(
    _ operation: () async throws -> T
) async rethrows -> (result: T, duration: Duration) {
    let start = ContinuousClock.now
    let result = try await operation()
    let duration = ContinuousClock.now - start
    return (result, duration)
}
```

## Dependencies
- **PROVISIONER**: Core protocols, error handling, lifecycle definitions
- **WORKER-02**: Actor isolation patterns and concurrency safety

## Validation Criteria
1. All capabilities must be actor-isolated
2. State transitions must complete within 10ms
3. Resource cleanup must be guaranteed on deactivation
4. No memory leaks in state observation streams
5. Thread-safe access to all capability methods
6. 100% test coverage for state transitions

## Migration Strategy
1. Existing capabilities wrapped in adapter pattern
2. Gradual conversion to actor-based implementation
3. Compatibility layer for callback-based APIs
4. Automated migration tooling for common patterns
