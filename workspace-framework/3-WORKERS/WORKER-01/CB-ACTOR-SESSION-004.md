### RED Phase - Advanced COW Optimization

**IMPLEMENTATION Test Written**: Validates optimized copy-on-write functionality with metrics
```swift

    var container = OptimizedCOWContainer(SimpleTestState())
    
    // Test initial access
    XCTAssertEqual(container.value.numbers.count, 0)
    
    // Test mutation
    container.value.numbers.append(42)
    XCTAssertEqual(container.value.numbers, [42])
    
    // Test metrics
    XCTAssertGreaterThan(container.metrics.totalReads, 0)
    XCTAssertGreaterThan(container.metrics.totalWrites, 0)
}

func testCOWSharing() {
    var container1 = OptimizedCOWContainer(SimpleTestState(value: 10))
    var container2 = container1
    
    // Both should have same initial value
    XCTAssertEqual(container1.value.value, 10)
    XCTAssertEqual(container2.value.value, 10)
    
    // Modify one
    container2.value.value = 20
    
    // Original should be unchanged
    XCTAssertEqual(container1.value.value, 10)
    XCTAssertEqual(container2.value.value, 20)
}
```

    // Extract in priority order (highest first)
    XCTAssertEqual(queue.extractMax()?.value, 2) // Critical
    XCTAssertEqual(queue.extractMax()?.value, 4) // High
    XCTAssertEqual(queue.extractMax()?.value, 3) // Normal

        memoryDelta: Int,
        stateSize: Int
    ) async {
        metrics.record(
            operation: StateOperation(
                type: type,
                duration: duration,

## API Design Decisions

### Decision: Adaptive COW Optimization Strategy
**Rationale**: Based on performance requirements from REQUIREMENTS-W-01-004 for >95% memory sharing
**Alternative Considered**: Static optimization strategies
**Why This Approach**: Enables runtime adaptation to actual usage patterns for optimal performance
**Test Impact**: COW metrics enable automated testing of sharing efficiency

### Decision: Priority-Based Batching with Deadline Awareness
**Rationale**: Sub-16ms update latency requirement demands intelligent scheduling
**Alternative Considered**: Simple FIFO batching
**Why This Approach**: Critical updates bypass batching while maintaining throughput for bulk operations
**Test Impact**: Priority testing ensures deadline compliance under load

### Decision: Compressed State Storage with Adaptive Caching
**Rationale**: Large state management scenarios require memory-efficient storage
**Alternative Considered**: Always-in-memory or always-compressed approaches
**Why This Approach**: Balances memory efficiency with access performance based on usage patterns
**Test Impact**: Cache policy testing validates memory pressure response
