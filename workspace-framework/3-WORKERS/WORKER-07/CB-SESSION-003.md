        "/// Build-time unidirectional flow validation",
        "public func validateUnidirectionalFlow() {",
        "    // Validate all component type combinations"
    ]
    
    // Generate validation for all component combinations
    for from in ComponentType.allCases {
        for to in ComponentType.allCases {
            if !validate(from: from, to: to) {
                validationCode.append("""
                #if canImport(\\(from.description)Module) && canImport(\\(to.description)Module)
                #error("UnidirectionalFlow violation: \\(errorMessage(from: from, to: to))")

    switch caseType {
    case .ownership:
        // Client-State ownership validation
        if from == .client && to == .state {
            return SpecialCaseResult(isValid: true, caseType: .ownership, message: "Client owns State")
        } else if from == .state && to == .client {
            return SpecialCaseResult(isValid: false, caseType: .ownership, message: "State cannot depend on Client")
        } else {

**Pattern Extracted**: [Comprehensive flow validation pattern with compile-time tokens and runtime analysis]
**Measured Results**: [Complete unidirectional flow validation system with architectural compliance]

## API Design Decisions

### Decision: DependencyValidatable protocol with token system
**Rationale**: Based on requirement for compile-time dependency validation with clear error messages
**Alternative Considered**: Runtime-only validation
**Why This Approach**: Provides compile-time safety with detailed architectural guidance
**Test Impact**: Enables comprehensive testing of protocol-based validation and token generation

### Decision: Comprehensive FlowAnalysisResult system
**Rationale**: Detailed flow analysis with violation categorization and cycle detection
**Alternative Considered**: Simple boolean validation
**Why This Approach**: Provides comprehensive diagnostic information for complex flow graphs
**Test Impact**: Allows precise testing of flow analysis logic and violation reporting

### Decision: Special case validation for ownership/binding
**Rationale**: Client-State and Context-Presentation relationships require specialized validation
**Alternative Considered**: Generic dependency rules
**Why This Approach**: Enables framework to handle architectural special cases correctly
**Test Impact**: Provides testable interface for ownership and binding validation scenarios
