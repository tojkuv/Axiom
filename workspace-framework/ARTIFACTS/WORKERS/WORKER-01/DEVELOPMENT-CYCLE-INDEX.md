## Completion Status
**All Requirements Completed**: WORKER-01 development complete ✅
**Performance Targets Met**: All Phase 3 objectives exceeded ✅  
**Ready for Stabilizer Integration**: All APIs documented and tested ✅
**Final Status**: MVP state management domain implementation complete

## Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1**: Requires P-001 (Core Protocol Foundation) from PROVISIONER
- **Phase 2**: Requires Phase 1 completion within WORKER-01 folder
- **Phase 3**: Requires Phase 2 completion within WORKER-01 folder

## Worker Scope
State Management Domain - Complete isolation focused on:
- Immutable state patterns and enforcement
- State ownership and lifecycle management  
- Enhanced mutation DSL and operators
- Performance optimization strategies
- High-performance state propagation

## Quality Targets
- Build integrity: Zero errors for worker changes
- Test coverage: >90% for worker components
- Performance: <16ms state propagation, <1ms mutations
- Memory efficiency: >95% COW sharing, <2x peak usage
