## Worker-Isolated TDD Development Log

### RED Phase - NavigationFlow and FlowStep Protocols

**IMPLEMENTATION Test Written**: Validates flow protocol system with multi-step workflow support
```swift
// Test written for worker's specific requirement: navigation flow patterns
func testNavigationFlowProtocolDefinition() throws {
    // This test should fail initially as flow protocols don't exist
    struct OnboardingFlow: NavigationFlow {
        let identifier: String = "onboarding"
        let steps: [FlowStep] = [
            WelcomeStep(),
            ProfileStep(),
            PreferencesStep()
        ]
        
        var metadata: FlowMetadata {
            FlowMetadata(
                title: "User Onboarding",
                description: "Complete your profile setup",
                estimatedDuration: 300
            )
        }
    }
    
    struct WelcomeStep: FlowStep {
        let identifier: String = "welcome"
        let isRequired: Bool = true
        let canSkip: Bool = false
        
        func validate(data: FlowData) -> Bool {
            return true // Welcome step always valid
        }
    }
    
    let flow = OnboardingFlow()
    XCTAssertEqual(flow.identifier, "onboarding")
    XCTAssertEqual(flow.steps.count, 3)
    XCTAssertEqual(flow.steps[0].identifier, "welcome")
}
```

    func cancel() async
}
