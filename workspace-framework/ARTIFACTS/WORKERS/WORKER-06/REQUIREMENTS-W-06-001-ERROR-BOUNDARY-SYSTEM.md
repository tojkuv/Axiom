# REQUIREMENTS-W-06-001-ERROR-BOUNDARY-SYSTEM

## Overview
This requirement defines the comprehensive error boundary system for the AxiomFramework. Error boundaries ensure proper error isolation, containment, and recovery across component hierarchies while maintaining Task context integrity.

## Goals
- Establish automatic error boundary creation and management
- Ensure proper error isolation between component hierarchies
- Maintain Task context integrity during error propagation
- Provide flexible recovery strategies for different error types
- Enable error boundary composition and hierarchy

## Requirements

### 1. Core Error Boundary Protocol
- **ErrorBoundary Protocol**
  - MUST define contracts for error handling across components
  - MUST support async error handling methods
  - MUST include source identification for error tracking
  - MUST be @MainActor-bound for UI safety

### 2. Error Boundary Context Integration
- **Context Error Boundaries**
  - MUST automatically create error boundaries for all contexts
  - MUST support parent-child boundary relationships
  - MUST handle boundary lifecycle with context lifecycle
  - MUST provide default error handling strategies

### 3. Client-Context Error Propagation
- **Automatic Propagation**
  - MUST capture all errors from Client actor methods
  - MUST propagate errors to associated Context boundaries
  - MUST maintain error metadata during propagation
  - MUST preserve Task context during propagation

### 4. Error Boundary Hierarchy
- **Hierarchical Management**
  - MUST support nested error boundaries
  - MUST propagate unhandled errors up the hierarchy
  - MUST allow boundary-specific recovery strategies
  - MUST maintain weak references to prevent retain cycles

### 5. Recovery Strategy Application
- **Strategy Execution**
  - MUST support multiple recovery strategies (retry, fallback, propagate)
  - MUST apply strategies based on error type and context
  - MUST track retry attempts and backoff delays
  - MUST support custom recovery handlers

### 6. Error Boundary Composition
- **Composable Boundaries**
  - MUST support boundary composition patterns
  - MUST allow multiple boundaries per component
  - MUST enable boundary middleware chains
  - MUST support dynamic boundary configuration

### 7. Unhandled Error Management
- **Fallback Handling**
  - MUST catch all unhandled errors
  - MUST provide default logging for unhandled errors
  - MUST support global error handlers
  - MUST integrate with crash reporting services

### 8. Error Metrics and Monitoring
- **Boundary Metrics**
  - MUST track error counts per boundary
  - MUST measure recovery success rates
  - MUST monitor boundary performance impact
  - MUST support custom metric collectors

### 9. Macro-Generated Boundaries
- **Automatic Generation**
  - MUST generate boundary code via @ErrorBoundary macro
  - MUST wrap async throwing methods automatically
  - MUST preserve method signatures and types
  - MUST support custom boundary configurations

### 10. Testing Support
- **Boundary Testing**
  - MUST provide test helpers for boundary verification
  - MUST support error injection for testing
  - MUST enable boundary behavior mocking
  - MUST validate error propagation paths

## Examples

### Basic Error Boundary
```swift
@ErrorBoundary(strategy: .retry(maxAttempts: 3))
class TaskListContext: ObservableContext {
    func loadTasks() async throws {
        // Automatically wrapped with error boundary
        let tasks = try await client.fetchTasks()
    }
}
```

### Custom Recovery Strategy
```swift
@ErrorBoundary(
    strategy: .custom { error in
        switch error {
        case .network:
            return .retry(maxAttempts: 3, delay: 2.0)
        case .validation:
            return .userPrompt(message: "Please check your input")
        default:
            return .propagate
        }
    }
)
class FormContext: ObservableContext {
    // Error handling customized per error type
}
```

### Hierarchical Boundaries
```swift
@ErrorBoundary(strategy: .propagate)
class AppContext: ObservableContext {
    @ErrorBoundary(strategy: .retry(maxAttempts: 2))
    var taskContext: TaskContext
    
    func handleBoundaryError(_ error: Error) async {
        // App-level error handling
        await showErrorAlert(error)
    }
}
```

## Dependencies
- Error handling foundation from PROVISIONER
- Context lifecycle management system
- Client-Context association tracking
- Macro system for code generation
- Testing framework for boundary validation

## Validation Criteria
- Error boundaries automatically created for all contexts
- Errors properly propagated from clients to contexts
- Recovery strategies correctly applied based on error type
- Hierarchical error propagation working correctly
- Macro-generated boundaries function identically to manual ones
- Test coverage for all boundary scenarios
