# REQUIREMENTS-W-06-003-RECOVERY-STRATEGY-FRAMEWORK

## Overview
This requirement defines the comprehensive error recovery strategy framework for the AxiomFramework. The framework provides automatic and configurable recovery mechanisms for different error scenarios, enabling resilient applications.

## Goals
- Provide automatic error recovery mechanisms
- Support configurable retry strategies with backoff
- Enable fallback operations and graceful degradation
- Integrate recovery with error boundaries
- Maintain recovery metrics and monitoring

## Requirements

### 1. Core Recovery Strategies
- **Strategy Types**
  - MUST support retry with configurable attempts and delays
  - MUST support fallback to alternative operations
  - MUST support user prompt for manual recovery
  - MUST support silent logging and continuation
  - MUST support error propagation up the chain

### 2. Retry Mechanism
- **Intelligent Retry**
  - MUST implement exponential backoff strategies
  - MUST support linear and constant delay strategies
  - MUST respect maximum retry attempts
  - MUST skip retry for non-recoverable errors (validation)
  - MUST track retry attempts per error instance

### 3. Backoff Strategies
- **Configurable Delays**
  - MUST support no delay (immediate retry)
  - MUST support constant delay between attempts
  - MUST support linear delay increase
  - MUST support exponential backoff with max delay
  - MUST calculate delays based on attempt number

### 4. Fallback Operations
- **Alternative Paths**
  - MUST support type-safe fallback operations
  - MUST enable fallback value providers
  - MUST support async fallback operations
  - MUST chain multiple fallback options
  - MUST track fallback execution

### 5. Error Category Recovery
- **Category-Based Strategies**
  - MUST apply default strategies per error category
  - MUST support network errors with retry
  - MUST handle validation errors without retry
  - MUST manage authorization errors with prompts
  - MUST customize strategies per category

### 6. Recovery Context
- **Contextual Recovery**
  - MUST preserve operation context during recovery
  - MUST maintain error history through attempts
  - MUST support recovery metadata
  - MUST enable conditional recovery logic

### 7. Timeout Management
- **Operation Timeouts**
  - MUST support operation-level timeouts
  - MUST integrate timeouts with retry logic
  - MUST handle timeout errors appropriately
  - MUST support configurable timeout durations

### 8. Recovery Middleware
- **Extensible Recovery**
  - MUST support custom recovery handlers
  - MUST enable recovery strategy composition
  - MUST allow pre/post recovery hooks
  - MUST maintain middleware ordering

### 9. User Interaction Recovery
- **Manual Recovery**
  - MUST support user prompt strategies
  - MUST provide error message customization
  - MUST enable user choice for recovery
  - MUST integrate with UI error presentation

### 10. Recovery Metrics
- **Monitoring and Analytics**
  - MUST track recovery success rates
  - MUST monitor retry attempt distributions
  - MUST measure recovery latency impact
  - MUST support custom metric collectors

## Examples

### Basic Retry Strategy
```swift
@ErrorBoundary(strategy: .retry(maxAttempts: 3, delay: 2.0))
class NetworkContext: ObservableContext {
    func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
        // Automatically retried on failure
        try await client.performRequest()
    }
}
```

### Exponential Backoff
```swift
let strategy = RecoveryStrategy.retry(
    maxAttempts: 5,
    backoff: .exponential(initial: 1.0, multiplier: 2.0, maxDelay: 30.0)
)

try await errorBoundary.executeWithRecovery(strategy) {
    try await unstableNetworkCall()
}
```

### Fallback Operations
```swift
let result = await withErrorContext("loadUserData") {
    try await fetchFromNetwork()
}.recover { error in
    // Fallback to cache
    if let cached = await loadFromCache() {
        return .success(cached)
    }
    return .failure(error)
}
```

### Category-Based Recovery
```swift
extension ErrorBoundaryContext {
    func defaultRecoveryStrategy(for error: Error) -> RecoveryStrategy {
        switch ErrorCategory.categorize(error) {
        case .network:
            return .retry(maxAttempts: 3, delay: 2.0)
        case .validation:
            return .userPrompt(message: "Please correct your input")
        case .authorization:
            return .userPrompt(message: "Please sign in to continue")
        case .system:
            return .fail
        default:
            return .log(level: .warning)
        }
    }
}
```

### Timeout with Recovery
```swift
try await withTimeout(10.0) {
    try await longRunningOperation()
}.recoverWithRetry(
    maxAttempts: 2,
    delay: 5.0
) {
    // Retry with shorter timeout
    try await withTimeout(5.0) {
        try await longRunningOperation()
    }
}
```

### Custom Recovery Handler
```swift
let customRecovery = RecoveryStrategy.custom(id: "data-recovery") { error in
    // Check if we can recover
    if await canRecoverFromError(error) {
        await performDataRecovery()
    } else {
        // Escalate to user
        await showErrorAlert(error)
    }
}
```

## Dependencies
- Error boundary system for recovery execution
- Error categorization for strategy selection
- Backoff calculation utilities
- Timeout management infrastructure
- Metrics collection system

## Validation Criteria
- Retry strategies correctly apply backoff delays
- Non-recoverable errors skip retry attempts
- Fallback operations execute on permanent failures
- Recovery strategies integrate with error boundaries
- Metrics accurately track recovery attempts and success
- User prompts display appropriate error context
