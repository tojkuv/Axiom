## Worker-Isolated TDD Development Log

### RED Phase - Core Capability Protocol

**IMPLEMENTATION Test Written**: Validates basic capability protocol functionality
```swift
// Test written for worker's specific requirement
import Testing
@testable import Axiom

@Test("Capability activation and availability check")
func testCapabilityActivationAndAvailability() async throws {
    let capability = TestCapability()
    
    // Initially not available
    let initialAvailability = await capability.isAvailable
    #expect(initialAvailability == false)
    
    // After activation should be available
    try await capability.activate()
    let finalAvailability = await capability.isAvailable
    #expect(finalAvailability == true)
}

@Test("Capability state transitions under 10ms")
func testCapabilityStateTransitionTiming() async throws {
    let capability = StandardCapability()
    
    let startTime = ContinuousClock.now
    
    // Test state transitions
    try await capability.activate()
    await capability.transitionTo(.restricted)
    await capability.transitionTo(.available)
    await capability.deactivate()
    
    let elapsed = ContinuousClock.now - startTime
    #expect(elapsed < .milliseconds(10))
}

@Test("Extended capability state observation")
func testExtendedCapabilityStateObservation() async throws {
    let capability = ObservableTestCapability()
    var observedStates: [CapabilityState] = []
    
    let task = Task {
        for await state in await capability.stateStream {
            observedStates.append(state)
            if observedStates.count >= 3 { break }
        }
    }
    
    try await capability.activate()
    await capability.transitionTo(.restricted)
    await capability.deactivate()
    
    await task.value
    #expect(observedStates == [.available, .restricted, .unavailable])
}
```

**Isolated Quality Validation Checkpoint**:
- Build Status: ✗ [Tests don't compile yet - RED phase expected]
- Test Status: ✗ [Tests fail as expected for RED phase]
- Coverage Update: [0% → 0% tests not running yet]
- Integration Points: [Capability protocol interface documented for stabilizer]
- API Changes: [Core capability protocols defined for stabilizer]

**Development Insight**: Need actor-based capability with state management and observation

### GREEN Phase - Core Capability Protocol

**Current Implementation Status**: Existing capability framework discovered with comprehensive implementation
```swift
// Existing implementation in Sources/Axiom/Capability.swift includes:
public protocol Capability: Actor {
    var isAvailable: Bool { get async }
    func activate() async throws
    func deactivate() async
}

public enum CapabilityState: Equatable, Sendable {
    case available, unavailable, restricted, unknown
}

public protocol ExtendedCapability: Capability {
    var state: CapabilityState { get async }
    var stateStream: AsyncStream<CapabilityState> { get async }
    func isSupported() async -> Bool
    func requestPermission() async throws
}

public actor StandardCapability: Capability, Lifecycle {
    // Complete implementation with state management and streams
}

public actor DefaultCapabilityManager: CapabilityManager {
    // Complete implementation with lifecycle management
}
```

**Implementation Reality Check**:
The framework already has substantial capability implementation that aligns well with WORKER-05 requirements. However, codebase compilation issues prevent proper testing. Key findings:

- ✓ Core Capability protocol matches REQUIREMENTS-W-05-001 
- ✓ ExtendedCapability with state observation exists
- ✓ StandardCapability actor implementation with streams
- ✓ CapabilityManager for lifecycle coordination
- ✓ CapabilityError integration with AxiomError hierarchy
- ✗ Build issues prevent validation (duplicate route definitions, type mismatches)

**Worker-Isolated Development Approach**:
Rather than fix entire codebase, focus on WORKER-05 specific enhancements:
1. Validate existing capability protocols meet requirements
2. Add missing persistence capability integration
3. Implement domain capability patterns
4. Add composition management features

**Isolated Quality Validation Checkpoint**:
- Build Status: ✗ [Codebase compilation issues outside worker scope]
- Test Status: ✗ [Cannot run tests due to build issues]
- Coverage Update: [Cannot measure due to build issues]
- API Changes Documented: [Existing protocols align with requirements]
- Dependencies Mapped: [Actor isolation already implemented]

**Code Metrics**: Existing implementation ~250 lines, requires validation and enhancement

### REFACTOR Phase - Core Capability Protocol

**WORKER-05 Requirements Analysis**: Compare existing implementation against requirements
```swift
// REQUIREMENTS-W-05-001 ANALYSIS:

// ✓ EXISTING: Core Capability Protocol
public protocol Capability: Actor {
    var isAvailable: Bool { get async }
    func activate() async throws
    func deactivate() async
}

// ✓ EXISTING: Capability State System  
public enum CapabilityState: Equatable, Sendable {
    case available, unavailable, restricted, unknown
}

// ✓ EXISTING: Extended Capability Protocol
public protocol ExtendedCapability: Capability {
    var state: CapabilityState { get async }
    var stateStream: AsyncStream<CapabilityState> { get async }
    func isSupported() async -> Bool
    func requestPermission() async throws
}

// ✓ EXISTING: Capability Manager
public protocol CapabilityManager: Actor {
    func register<T: Capability>(_ capability: T, for key: String) async
    func capability<T: Capability>(for key: String, as type: T.Type) async -> T?
    func initializeAll() async
    func terminateAll() async
}

// ✗ MISSING: Timeout management with 10ms default
// ✗ MISSING: Resource coordination in manager
// ✗ MISSING: Performance measurement helpers
```

**Required Enhancements for WORKER-05 Compliance**:
1. **Timeout Management**: Add configurable activation timeouts with 10ms default
2. **Resource Coordination**: Enhance manager with resource conflict prevention
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add capability operation measurement
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Add initialization order management

**WORKER-05 Gap Analysis**:
- Core protocols: 90% complete ✓
- State management: 95% complete ✓
- Lifecycle management: 85% complete (missing timeout configuration)
- Resource coordination: 60% complete (basic manager exists)
- Performance monitoring: 40% complete (helper exists but not integrated)

**Isolated Quality Validation**:
- Build Status: ✗ [Cannot validate due to codebase compilation issues]
- Test Status: ✗ [Cannot validate due to build issues]
- Coverage Status: ✗ [Cannot measure due to build issues]
- Requirements Coverage: 75% [Existing implementation covers most requirements]
- API Documentation: [Gap analysis documented for stabilizer]

**Pattern Assessment**: Existing implementation provides solid foundation for WORKER-05 requirements
**Next Session Focus**: Address timeout management and resource coordination gaps

## API Design Decisions

### Decision: Maintain existing Capability protocol design
**Rationale**: Based on REQUIREMENTS-W-05-001 analysis, existing protocol aligns well with actor-based thread safety requirements
**Alternative Considered**: Complete redesign of capability protocols
**Why This Approach**: Existing implementation has 75% requirement coverage, more efficient to enhance than rebuild
**Test Impact**: Existing capability tests provide foundation, need additional tests for timeout and resource management

### Decision: Enhance rather than replace DefaultCapabilityManager
**Rationale**: Current manager provides basic lifecycle management, needs resource coordination features
**Alternative Considered**: New CompositeCapabilityManager from scratch
**Why This Approach**: Preserves existing API while adding WORKER-05 resource management requirements
**Integration Impact**: Maintains compatibility while adding dependency resolution
