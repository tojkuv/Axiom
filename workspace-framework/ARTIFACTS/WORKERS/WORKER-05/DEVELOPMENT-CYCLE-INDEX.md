## Next Folder Session Plan
**Target**: Begin REQUIREMENTS-W-05-005 capability composition management (Phase 3)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**MVP Priority**: Dependency management, resource sharing, hierarchical capabilities
**Isolation Note**: No coordination with other parallel workers required

## Phase Technical Priorities

### Phase 1 Technical Foundation
1. **Core Capability Protocol**: Actor-based thread-safe external system interfaces
2. **Lifecycle Management**: Standardized activation/deactivation with 10ms transitions  
3. **State System**: AsyncStream-based state observation with deterministic transitions
4. **Persistence Framework**: Type-safe storage with multiple backend adapters
5. **Error Integration**: AxiomError hierarchy integration with capability-specific errors

### Phase 2 Advanced Capabilities
1. **Extended Patterns**: Configuration management, resource tracking, environment adaptation
2. **Domain Implementations**: ML/AI, payment, analytics, network, hardware capabilities
3. **Resource Management**: Usage tracking, allocation limits, memory pressure handling
4. **Platform Integration**: SDK wrapping patterns with type safety preservation

### Phase 3 Composition System
1. **Dependency Management**: Topological dependency resolution with circular detection
2. **Resource Sharing**: Priority-based allocation with usage monitoring
3. **Hierarchical Capabilities**: Parent-child relationships with state propagation
4. **Adaptive Composition**: Environment-aware capability selection and configuration

## Quality Targets (Worker Scope)
- Build integrity: 100% maintained throughout development
- Test coverage: >90% for all capability protocols and implementations
- Performance: State transitions <10ms, <5% overhead for SDK wrapping
- Thread safety: All capabilities must be actor-isolated
- Resource cleanup: Guaranteed cleanup on deactivation
- Error handling: Comprehensive error propagation and recovery

## Integration Dependencies (For Stabilizer)
- **PROVISIONER**: Core protocols, error handling, lifecycle definitions
- **WORKER-01**: State management patterns for capability state
- **WORKER-02**: Actor isolation patterns and concurrency safety
- **Platform SDKs**: AVFoundation, CoreML, PassKit, CoreBluetooth integration

## Session Planning Notes
- Each session focuses on single requirement completion
- TDD approach with RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycles
- Worker-scope validation at each checkpoint
- Integration documentation captured for stabilizer
- No cross-worker dependencies or coordination required
