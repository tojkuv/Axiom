## Worker-Isolated TDD Development Log

### RED Phase - Enhanced Dependency Validation

**IMPLEMENTATION Test Written**: Comprehensive validation for advanced dependency scenarios
```swift
func testSelfDependencyPrevention() {
    let selfDependencies: [ComponentType: Set<ComponentType>] = [
        .client: [.client]  // Self-dependency
    ]
    
    let result = DependencyRules.validateDependencyGraph(selfDependencies)
    XCTAssertFalse(result.isValid, "Self-dependencies should be invalid")
    XCTAssertTrue(result.violations.contains { $0.violationType == .selfDependency })
}

func testCycleDetectionWithPath() {
    let cyclicDependencies: [ComponentType: Set<ComponentType>] = [
        .client: [.context],
        .context: [.orchestrator],
        .orchestrator: [.client]  // Creates cycle
    ]
    
    let result = DependencyRules.validateDependencyGraph(cyclicDependencies)
    XCTAssertFalse(result.isValid)
    let cycleViolation = result.violations.first { $0.violationType == .cyclicDependency }
    XCTAssertNotNil(cycleViolation?.cyclePath)
}

func testRuntimeDependencyRegistration() {
    let validator = DependencyRules.RuntimeValidator()
    let validResult = validator.registerDependency(from: .client, to: .capability, context: "TestValidation")
    XCTAssertTrue(validResult.isSuccess)
    
    let invalidResult = validator.registerDependency(from: .client, to: .client, context: "TestValidation")
    XCTAssertFalse(invalidResult.isSuccess)
}
```

### GREEN Phase - Enhanced Validation Implementation

**IMPLEMENTATION Code Written**: [Comprehensive enhanced validation system]
```swift
/// Comprehensive dependency graph validation with detailed violation reporting
public static func validateDependencyGraph(_ dependencies: [ComponentType: Set<ComponentType>]) -> DependencyValidationResult {
    var violations: [DependencyViolation] = []
    
    // Check for self-dependencies
    for (component, deps) in dependencies {
        if deps.contains(component) {
            violations.append(DependencyViolation(
                from: component,
                to: component,
                violationType: .selfDependency,
                message: "Component \(component.description) cannot depend on itself",
                cyclePath: [component, component]
            ))
        }
    }
    
    // Check for rule violations and cycles
    // [Complete implementation with path tracking]
}

/// Runtime dependency validator for dynamic validation
class RuntimeValidator {
    private var registeredDependencies: [String: (ComponentType, ComponentType)] = [:]
    
    public func registerDependency(from: ComponentType, to: ComponentType, context: String) -> DependencyRegistrationResult {
        // Validation logic with detailed error reporting
    }
}

/// Types for enhanced validation
public struct DependencyValidationResult {
    public let isValid: Bool
    public let violations: [DependencyViolation]
}

public struct DependencyViolation {
    public let from: ComponentType
    public let to: ComponentType
    public let violationType: DependencyViolationType
    public let message: String
    public let cyclePath: [ComponentType]?
}

public enum DependencyViolationType: Equatable, CaseIterable {
    case selfDependency
    case cyclicDependency

### REFACTOR Phase - Performance and Integration Optimization

**IMPLEMENTATION Optimization Performed**: [Build-time integration and performance improvements]
```swift
/// Generates build-time validation code for CI/CD integration
public static func generateBuildTimeValidation() -> String {
    var validationCode = [
        "// Auto-generated build-time dependency validation",
        "// Generated on: \(Date())"
    ]
    
    // Generate validation for all invalid dependency combinations
    for source in ComponentType.allCases {
        for target in ComponentType.allCases {
            if !isValidDependency(from: source, to: target) {
                validationCode.append("""
                #if canImport(\(source.description)Module) && canImport(\(target.description)Module)
                #error("\(dependencyError(from: source, to: target))")
                #endif
                """)
            }
        }
    }
    
    return validationCode.joined(separator: "\n")
}

/// Enhanced cycle detection with full path information
private static func detectCyclesWithPaths(_ dependencies: [ComponentType: Set<ComponentType>]) -> [DependencyViolation] {
    // Advanced cycle detection algorithm with path tracking
    // Provides complete cycle paths for debugging
}
```

## API Design Decisions

### Decision: Comprehensive DependencyValidationResult system
**Rationale**: Based on requirement for detailed violation reporting with cycle paths
**Alternative Considered**: Simple boolean validation
**Why This Approach**: Provides detailed diagnostic information for complex dependency graphs
**Test Impact**: Enables comprehensive testing of violation scenarios and error reporting

### Decision: Separate violation types enum
**Rationale**: Clear categorization of different types of dependency violations
**Alternative Considered**: Generic error messages
**Why This Approach**: Enables specific handling and remediation strategies for each violation type
**Test Impact**: Allows precise testing of violation detection logic

### Decision: Runtime validator with registration tracking
**Rationale**: Support for dynamic component systems requiring runtime validation
**Alternative Considered**: Compile-time only validation
**Why This Approach**: Enables framework to validate dependencies in dynamic scenarios
**Test Impact**: Provides testable interface for runtime dependency scenarios
