## API Design Decisions

**Core Architecture Patterns**:
- **Actor-Based Design**: All primary components use actors for thread-safe concurrent access
- **Token-Based Cancellation**: CancellationToken provides the central cancellation coordination point
- **Priority-Aware Operations**: PriorityTask enables priority inheritance and boost/restore patterns
- **Checkpoint-Based Operations**: CheckpointContext allows long operations to be cancellable with state preservation
- **Hierarchical Cleanup**: CleanupCoordinator provides ordered cleanup with parallel execution where safe
- **High-Precision Timing**: TimeoutManager uses nanosecond precision for accurate timeout handling

**Performance-First Design**:
- All performance targets embedded as design constraints (< 10ms, < 100ns, < 1μs, < 50ms)
- Memory pooling and bounded storage for scalability
- Parallel execution patterns for optimal throughput
- Comprehensive metrics for continuous optimization

**Integration Strategy**:
- Built on existing StructuredTaskCoordinator patterns from W-02-002
- Compatible with framework's actor isolation principles
- Extensible for future cancellation patterns
