*TDD Actor Parallel Development Session*

**Actor Role**: Parallel TDD Actor
**Worker Folder**: WORKER-02

**Session Type**: IMPLEMENTATION
**Date**: 2025-11-06 18:45
**Duration**: TBD (including isolated quality validation)
**Focus**: Structured Concurrency Coordination Framework for AxiomFramework
**Parallel Worker Isolation**: Complete isolation from other parallel workers (2-8 total workers)

Quality Validation: How we verified the new functionality works within worker's isolated scope
Build Integrity: Build validation status for worker's changes only
Test Coverage: Coverage progression for worker's code additions
Integration Points Documented: API contracts and dependencies documented for stabilizer
Worker Isolation: Complete isolation maintained - no awareness of other parallel workers

## Issues Being Addressed
