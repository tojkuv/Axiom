# REQUIREMENTS-S-004: Framework Purpose Validation

## Overview
Validate that the Axiom framework fulfills its core purpose of enabling scalable, maintainable SwiftUI applications with clear separation of concerns.

## Dependencies
- Complete framework implementation
- All architectural patterns implemented
- Worker component outputs integrated

## Core Requirements

### 1. Architecture Validation
- Verify unidirectional data flow implementation
- Validate separation of concerns
- Ensure modularity and composability
- Confirm testability architecture

### 2. Developer Experience Validation
- Validate API discoverability
- Ensure consistent patterns
- Verify documentation completeness
- Confirm debugging capabilities

### 3. Scalability Verification
- Test framework with large applications
- Validate performance at scale
- Verify module isolation
- Ensure incremental adoption path

### 4. Maintainability Assessment
- Validate code organization patterns
- Verify refactoring safety
- Ensure upgrade path clarity
- Confirm backward compatibility

## Validation Scenarios
1. Build reference application using framework
2. Perform complex refactoring exercises
3. Test incremental adoption in existing app
4. Validate team collaboration workflows

## Purpose Fulfillment Criteria
- Clear separation between UI and logic
- Predictable state management
- Testable architecture patterns
- Scalable application structure

## Deliverables
1. Framework purpose validation report
2. Reference application implementation
3. Migration guide from vanilla SwiftUI
4. Best practices documentation

## Success Metrics
- Reference app demonstrates all patterns
- 90% reduction in boilerplate code
- 100% unit test coverage achievable
- Clear architectural boundaries maintained
