# REQUIREMENTS-S-002: Cross-Component Integration

## Overview
Ensure seamless integration between all framework components with focus on data flow, state management, and lifecycle coordination.

## Dependencies
- Completed implementations from all workers
- All component APIs finalized
- Framework architecture solidified

## Core Requirements

### 1. Component Communication Validation
- Test Context-Client-Orchestrator integration
- Validate navigation flow completeness
- Verify capability composition chains
- Ensure presentation binding integrity

### 2. State Synchronization Testing
- Validate state propagation across components
- Test concurrent state updates
- Verify state isolation boundaries
- Ensure observable state consistency

### 3. Lifecycle Coordination
- Test component initialization sequences
- Validate dependency injection timing
- Verify cleanup and deallocation
- Ensure proper error boundary propagation

### 4. Data Flow Integration
- Validate unidirectional data flow
- Test action dispatch chains
- Verify state mutation patterns
- Ensure data transformation consistency

## Integration Test Scenarios
1. Full application lifecycle simulation
2. Complex navigation flow testing
3. Concurrent capability execution
4. Error propagation across boundaries
5. Performance under load conditions

## Validation Criteria
- All components integrate without conflicts
- State remains consistent across components
- Lifecycle events fire in correct order
- Data flows maintain type safety

## Deliverables
1. Integration test suite
2. Component interaction matrix
3. Data flow diagrams
4. Lifecycle sequence documentation

## Success Metrics
- 100% integration test coverage
- Zero runtime integration errors
- Consistent state across all components
- Predictable lifecycle behavior
