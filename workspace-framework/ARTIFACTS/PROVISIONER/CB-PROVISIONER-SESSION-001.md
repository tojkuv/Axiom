## Issues Being Addressed

### FOUNDATION-P-001: Core Protocol Foundation Infrastructure
**Original Report**: PROVISIONER/REQUIREMENTS-P-001-CORE-PROTOCOL-FOUNDATION
**Foundation Type**: BOOTSTRAP
**Criticality**: Required before parallel work can begin
**Target Foundation**: Client, Context, and Capability protocols with standardized implementations

## Foundational TDD Development Log

### RED Phase - Core Protocol Foundation

**Test Written**: Validates all foundational protocol requirements
```swift
// Test for Client protocol conformance and behavior
func testClientProtocolConformance() async throws {
    let client = TestableClient()
    
    // Test state stream exists
    let stream = await client.stateStream
    XCTAssertNotNil(stream, "Client must provide stateStream")
    
    // Test process method exists
    try await client.process(.increment)
}

// Test for state propagation performance requirement
func testClientStatePropagationWithin5ms() async throws {
    let client = TestableClient()
    var receivedStates: [TestState] = []
    
    // Measure state propagation time
    let start = ContinuousClock.now
    try await client.process(.increment)
    let elapsed = ContinuousClock.now - start
    
    XCTAssertLessThan(elapsed, .milliseconds(5), "State propagation must complete within 5ms")
}

// Test for Context protocol with lifecycle
func testContextProtocolConformance() async throws {
    let context = TestableContext()
    
    // Test MainActor binding
    XCTAssertTrue(Thread.isMainThread, "Context operations must run on MainActor")
    
    // Test lifecycle methods
    try await context.activate()
    await context.deactivate()
}

// Test for Capability protocol with state transitions
func testCapabilityStateTransitions() async throws {
    let capability = StandardCapability()
    
    let start = ContinuousClock.now
    await capability.transitionTo(.available)
    let elapsed = ContinuousClock.now - start
    
    XCTAssertLessThan(elapsed, .milliseconds(10), "State transition must complete within 10ms")
}
```

**Quality Validation Checkpoint**:
- Build Status: ✓ [Axiom library builds successfully]
- Test Status: ✗ [Tests written but not yet passing - RED phase]
- Coverage Update: [0% → Target 80%]
- Foundation Pattern: Actor-based concurrency established for thread safety

**Foundational Insight**: The framework already has well-defined protocols that need standardization and comprehensive testing. The existing implementations provide a solid foundation but lack complete test coverage.

### Existing Foundation Analysis

**Code Discovered**: Existing protocol implementations found
```swift
// Client.swift - Already has comprehensive protocol definition
public protocol Client<StateType, ActionType>: Actor {
    associatedtype StateType: State
    associatedtype ActionType
    
    var stateStream: AsyncStream<StateType> { get }
    func process(_ action: ActionType) async throws
}

// Context.swift - Already has lifecycle and MainActor binding
@MainActor
public protocol Context: ObservableObject, Lifecycle {
    func handleChildAction<T>(_ action: T, from child: any Context)
}

// Capability.swift - Already has state management
public protocol Capability: Actor {
    var isAvailable: Bool { get async }
    func activate() async throws
    func deactivate() async
}
```

**Compilation Issues Fixed**:
1. Removed duplicate ErrorContext definition in StateOptimization.swift
2. Renamed StateDiff to StateChanges to resolve ambiguity
3. Fixed @Published property wrapper on computed property
4. Added SwiftUI import for View type references
5. Fixed type inference issues in generic code

**Quality Validation Checkpoint**:
- Build Status: ✓ [All compilation errors resolved]
- Test Status: ✗ [Tests need protocol compliance verification]
- Regression Check: N/A [Initial implementation]
- Coverage Update: [Awaiting test execution]
- Foundation Stability: ✓ [Core protocols compile and are ready for testing]

## Foundational API Design Decisions

### Decision: Actor-based thread safety for all stateful components
**Rationale**: Provides compile-time guarantees of thread safety
**Alternative Considered**: Lock-based synchronization
**Why This Approach**: Swift concurrency provides better performance and safety
**Pattern Impact**: All parallel workers must use async/await for state access

### Decision: MainActor binding for UI contexts
**Rationale**: Ensures UI updates happen on main thread
**Alternative Considered**: Manual dispatch to main queue
**Why This Approach**: Compile-time enforcement prevents UI threading bugs
**Pattern Impact**: Context protocol automatically handles UI thread requirements

### Decision: Lifecycle protocol for resource management
**Rationale**: Standardizes activation/deactivation across all components
**Alternative Considered**: Component-specific lifecycle methods
**Why This Approach**: Uniform interface simplifies resource management
**Pattern Impact**: All components can be managed through common lifecycle interface

## Insights for Parallel Actors

### Foundation Patterns Established
1. **Actor-based State Management**: All clients must be actors for thread safety
2. **MainActor UI Coordination**: All contexts automatically run on MainActor
3. **Lifecycle Resource Management**: activate()/deactivate() pattern for all components
4. **AsyncStream State Observation**: Standard pattern for observing state changes
5. **Protocol-based Composition**: Client/Context/Capability can be composed freely

### Architectural Guidelines
1. **State Ownership**: Each state instance owned by exactly one client
2. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State changes flow from Client → Context → View
3. **Error Propagation**: Use AxiomError hierarchy for all error cases
4. **Performance Requirements**: 5ms state propagation, 10ms capability transitions

### Foundation Handoff Notes
1. **Available Infrastructure**: Core protocols ready for implementation
2. **Thread Safety Guaranteed**: Actor isolation prevents data races
3. **UI Threading Handled**: Context protocol ensures MainActor execution
4. **Resource Management**: Lifecycle protocol provides cleanup hooks

## Foundation Technical Debt Prevention
1. **Protocol Standardization**: Prevents divergent implementations
2. **Actor Isolation**: Prevents threading bugs at compile time
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Prevents resource leaks
4. **Type Safety**: Generic protocols prevent runtime type errors

## GREEN Phase Continuation (Session Extended)

**Date**: 2025-01-11 15:45
**Additional Duration**: 1.0 hours
**Focus**: Attempting to achieve GREEN state for core protocol tests

### Compilation Challenges Discovered

During the GREEN phase, significant compilation issues were discovered that prevent running the comprehensive test suite:

1. **NavigationFlow Conflict**: Protocol and struct both named NavigationFlow
   - Fixed by renaming struct to NavigationFlowData
   - 57 compilation errors remain in the framework

2. **Capability Protocol Non-Conformance**: Multiple capability implementations missing required methods
   - ExtendedCapability implementations lack activate() and deactivate()
   - DomainCapability protocol hierarchy needs revision

3. **Cross-Module Dependencies**: Navigation and capability subsystems have interdependencies preventing isolated testing

### Mitigation Strategy

Created minimal test suite focusing only on core protocols:
- `BasicProtocolTests.swift` - Tests only the essential protocol functionality
- Validates State, Lifecycle, ObservableClient, ObservableContext, and StandardCapability
- Avoids problematic areas of the codebase

### GREEN Phase Results (Partial)

**Tests Created**:
1. State protocol conformance tests ✅
2. Lifecycle protocol basic tests ✅
3. ObservableClient state management tests ✅
4. ObservableContext lifecycle tests ✅
5. StandardCapability state transition tests ✅

**Unable to Execute Due to Compilation Errors**:
- Full framework build fails with 57 errors
- Test execution blocked by build failures
- Coverage analysis not possible

### Key Findings

1. **Core Protocols Are Sound**: The fundamental Client, Context, and Capability protocols are well-designed
2. **Implementation Gaps**: Extended implementations have missing protocol requirements
3. **Build System Issues**: Framework has accumulated technical debt preventing clean builds
4. **Test Strategy Adjustment Needed**: Need to fix compilation errors before comprehensive testing

### Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Fix Compilation Errors First**:
   - Address all 57 remaining build errors
   - Focus on capability protocol conformance
   - Resolve navigation subsystem conflicts

2. **Incremental Testing Approach**:
   - Test individual protocol implementations in isolation
   - Use minimal test files that compile independently
   - Build up to comprehensive test suite gradually

3. **Technical Debt Reduction**:
   - Remove or fix non-conforming capability examples
   - Consolidate duplicate type definitions
   - Simplify navigation flow types

### Foundation Status Update

- **Build**: ❌ Partial (core protocols compile, full framework fails)
- **Tests**: ❓ Written but cannot execute
- **Protocols**: ✅ Well-defined and compile
- **Coverage**: N/A (blocked by build failures)

The foundation protocols themselves are solid, but the broader framework needs cleanup before parallel actors can effectively begin their work.
