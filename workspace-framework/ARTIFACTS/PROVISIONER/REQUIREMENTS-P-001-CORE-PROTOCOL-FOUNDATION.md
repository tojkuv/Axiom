# REQUIREMENTS-P-001-CORE-PROTOCOL-FOUNDATION

## Requirement Overview

**ID**: P-001  
**Title**: Core Protocol Foundation Infrastructure  
**Type**: PROVISIONER - Foundational Infrastructure  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Worker**: PROVISIONER  
**Dependencies**: None (foundational)  

## Executive Summary

**Source Worker Analyses**: 
- FW-ANALYSIS-20250610-180417 (Codebase Exploration)
- FW-ANALYSIS-20250610-181024 (Framework Structure)  
- FW-ANALYSIS-20250610-183242 (Memory Management)

**Confirmation Tracking**: 3+ worker confirmations (critical priority)
- **Framework Exploration Workers**: Identified 47 core APIs requiring standardization
- **Memory Management Workers**: Found actor-based concurrency as foundational strength
- **Structure Analysis Workers**: Confirmed 3-layer architecture requiring protocol foundation

**Aggregated Evidence**: All autonomous workers confirmed the framework's actor-based architecture as its core strength, with Client/Context/Capability protocols serving as the foundational layer enabling all other development.

## Current State Analysis

**Current Framework State**:

2. **Lifecycle Management Foundation**
   - Universal Lifecycle protocol for all components
   - Activation/deactivation patterns
   - Resource cleanup automation
   - Memory leak prevention

3. **Concurrency Foundation**
   - Actor-based thread safety patterns
   - AsyncStream implementations for state observation
   - Task lifecycle management
   - Concurrent operation safety

4. **Performance Foundation**
   - Sub-5ms state propagation guarantees
   - Memory-efficient stream management
   - Resource pooling foundations
   - Performance monitoring hooks

## API Design

### Core Protocols

```swift
// Client Protocol - Actor-based state containers
public protocol Client<StateType, ActionType>: Actor {
    associatedtype StateType: State
    associatedtype ActionType
    
    var stateStream: AsyncStream<StateType> { get }
    func process(_ action: ActionType) async throws
}

// Context Protocol - MainActor UI coordinators  
@MainActor
public protocol Context: ObservableObject, Lifecycle {
    func handleChildAction<T>(_ action: T, from child: any Context)
}

// Capability Protocol - Actor-based system access
public protocol Capability: Actor {
    var isAvailable: Bool { get async }
    func activate() async throws
    func deactivate() async
}

// Universal Lifecycle Protocol
public protocol Lifecycle {
    func activate() async throws
    func deactivate() async
}
```

### Base Implementations

```swift
// Standard actor-based client implementation
public actor ObservableClient<S: State, A>: Client {
    public private(set) var state: S
    private var streamContinuations: [UUID: AsyncStream<S>.Continuation] = [:]
    
    public var stateStream: AsyncStream<S> { /* implementation */ }
    public func process(_ action: A) async throws { /* implementation */ }
}

// Observable context with lifecycle management
@MainActor
open class ObservableContext: Context {
    @Published private var updateTrigger = UUID()
    public private(set) var isActive = false
    
    open func activate() async throws { /* implementation */ }
    open func deactivate() async { /* implementation */ }
}

// Standard capability with state management
public actor StandardCapability: Capability, Lifecycle {
    public private(set) var state: CapabilityState = .unknown
    
    public var isAvailable: Bool { state == .available }
    public func activate() async throws { /* implementation */ }
    public func deactivate() async { /* implementation */ }
}
```

## Technical Design

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Actor-Based Thread Safety**
   - All clients are actors for state isolation
   - MainActor binding for UI components
   - Sendable conformance for data types

2. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Consistent activation/deactivation across all components
   - Resource cleanup automation
   - Memory leak prevention through weak references

3. **Stream-Based Observation**
   - AsyncStream for state updates
   - Multi-observer support with proper cleanup
   - Performance-optimized continuation management

4. **Error Handling Integration**
   - Protocol-level error propagation
   - Timeout handling for operations
   - Recovery strategy integration

### Performance Considerations

- **State Propagation**: < 5ms guarantee through optimized AsyncStream
- **Memory Management**: Weak reference patterns prevent cycles
- **Concurrency**: Actor isolation prevents data races
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic deactivation on deallocation

### Dependencies on Other Requirements

This requirement enables:
- All WORKER requirements depend on these foundational protocols
- Error handling patterns build on protocol foundation
- Navigation systems extend Context protocol
- State management utilizes Client protocol
- Testing utilities mock these protocol implementations

## Success Criteria

### Functional Validation

- [ ] **Protocol Compilation**: All core protocols compile without errors
- [ ] **Actor Safety**: No data race warnings in thread safety analysis
- [ ] **Lifecycle Testing**: Activation/deactivation cycles complete successfully
- [ ] **Stream Performance**: State propagation within 5ms requirement
- [ ] **Memory Safety**: No retain cycles in static analysis

### Integration Validation

- [ ] **Worker Enablement**: All parallel workers can build against protocols
- [ ] **Cross-Protocol Coordination**: Client/Context/Capability integration works
- [ ] **Lifecycle Coordination**: Components activate/deactivate in proper order
- [ ] **Error Integration**: Protocol errors integrate with AxiomError hierarchy
- [ ] **Testing Foundation**: Protocol mocking and testing utilities functional

### Performance Validation

- [ ] **State Update Performance**: AsyncStream yields within 5ms
- [ ] **Memory Footprint**: Protocol overhead < 1KB per instance
- [ ] **Actor Contention**: No actor deadlocks in concurrent scenarios
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: All resources released within 100ms of deactivation

## Worker Consensus Validation

**High Priority Confirmations (3+ workers)**:
- Core protocol foundation identified as critical enabler
- Actor-based thread safety confirmed as architectural strength
- Lifecycle management gaps requiring standardization
- Performance guarantees need protocol-level enforcement

**Implementation Strategy**: Implement base protocols first, then standard implementations, then performance optimizations, ensuring all parallel workers can immediately begin development against stable foundation.

This requirement addresses 100% of foundational infrastructure needs identified by autonomous workers and provides the essential protocols that enable all subsequent parallel development work.
