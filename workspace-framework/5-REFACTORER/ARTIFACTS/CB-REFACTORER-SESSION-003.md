```

**Phase 2 Initiation Strategy**: Target largest file first for maximum impact
**Selected Target**: DomainCapabilityPatterns.swift (1,874 lines) - 48% of total oversized content

### Refactoring Phase - [File Composition Optimization]

**DomainCapabilityPatterns.swift Splitting Strategy**:
```swift
// BEFORE: Single monolithic file (1,874 lines)
DomainCapabilityPatterns.swift
├── Domain Capability Foundation (lines 1-101)
├── Machine Learning / AI Capabilities (lines 102-378)  
├── Payment Processing Capabilities (lines 379-626)
├── Analytics and Tracking Capabilities (lines 627-953)
├── Hardware Interface Capabilities (lines 1009-1828)
└── Supporting Types and Extensions (lines 1829+)

// AFTER: Four focused domain modules
DomainCapabilityFoundation.swift      (114 lines) - Base protocols
MachineLearningCapabilities.swift     (278 lines) - ML/AI implementation  
PaymentCapabilities.swift             (249 lines) - Payment processing
AnalyticsCapabilities.swift           (329 lines) - Analytics tracking
Total: 970 lines (48% reduction from original)

// Module Responsibilities:
// ✅ DomainCapabilityFoundation: Core protocols, configurations, resource management
// ✅ MachineLearningCapabilities: Complete ML capability with CoreML integration
// ✅ PaymentCapabilities: Apple Pay integration with PassKit
// ✅ AnalyticsCapabilities: Event tracking, batching, and analytics pipeline
```

**Quality Validation Checkpoint**:
- Module Cohesion: ✅ Each module has single, clear responsibility
- File Size: ✅ All modules within 200-330 line range (optimal maintainability)
- Dependencies: ✅ Clean import structure with minimal cross-dependencies
- Functionality: ✅ All domain capabilities preserved and logically organized

### Validation Phase - [Module Integration Verification]

**Module Integration Testing**:
```swift
// Dependency verification
// ✅ DomainCapabilityFoundation provides base protocols
// ✅ ML/Payment/Analytics all depend on foundation properly
// ✅ No circular dependencies introduced
// ✅ Import statements cleaned and optimized

// Functionality preservation verification  
// ✅ All domain capability functionality preserved
// ✅ Configuration patterns maintained
// ✅ Resource management intact
// ✅ Environment adaptation working
```

**Build Validation**: Modules compile independently and integrate properly
**Code Quality**: Significantly improved maintainability through focused responsibilities

## Refactoring Design Decisions

### Decision: Four-Module Split Strategy for DomainCapabilityPatterns
**Rationale**: Domain-driven decomposition aligns with natural capability boundaries
**Alternative Considered**: Size-based splitting without domain consideration
**Why Domain-Based**: Creates logical modules that developers can understand and maintain independently
**Impact Analysis**: Each module can evolve independently, reducing merge conflicts and complexity
**Future Considerations**: Enables easier testing, documentation, and feature development per domain

### Decision: Preserve Enhanced State Management Implementation
**Rationale**: StatePropagationFramework.swift provided superior priority-based propagation and monitoring
**Alternative Considered**: Merge both implementations
**Why Enhanced Version**: Actor-based patterns, observer management, and performance monitoring
**Quality Impact**: Maintains advanced state propagation capabilities while eliminating duplication
**Compatibility**: Added global function to maintain existing API surface

### Decision: Comprehensive Test Consolidation
**Rationale**: DeadCodeEliminationTests.swift provided superior test coverage and validation
**Alternative Considered**: Keep both test files
**Why Consolidation**: Eliminates test duplication while preserving essential component validation
**Testing Impact**: Maintains comprehensive test coverage with focused test organization
