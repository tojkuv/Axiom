# RESPONSIBILITY-AREA-MAPPING

## Document Overview

**Document Type**: Framework Responsibility Area to Worker Assignment Mapping  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Framework**: AxiomFramework  
**Mapping Scope**: 8 core responsibility areas distributed across 7 workers + provisioner + stabilizer

**Scope**: Unidirectional flow, dependency rules, component validation, macro system, API standardization  
**Core Components**: UnidirectionalFlow.swift, DependencyRules.swift, ComponentType.swift, Macros.swift, StandardizedAPI.swift  
**Assigned To**: WORKER-07  

### 8. Testing Infrastructure Domain
**Scope**: Test helpers, performance testing, mock generation, test scenarios, assertions  
**Core Components**: All files in AxiomTesting module (19 components)  
**Addressed By**: Distributed across all workers + PROVISIONER (base testing)

- **Components per Worker**: ~8-10 components
- **Requirements per Worker**: 5 (uniform distribution)

### Domain Coverage Verification

| Domain | Components | Worker | Requirements | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| State Management | 5 | WORKER-01 | 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Concurrency | 3 | WORKER-02 | 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Context/UI | 5 | WORKER-03 | 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Navigation | 6 | WORKER-04 | 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Capabilities | 5 | WORKER-05 | 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Error Handling | 3 | WORKER-06 | 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Architecture | 12 | WORKER-07 | 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Testing | 19 | All Workers | Distributed | ✓ Complete |

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

Testing infrastructure requirements were distributed across all workers to ensure each domain has appropriate testing support:
- Each worker's requirements include testing specifications
- PROVISIONER established base testing framework (P-005)
- STABILIZER validates system-wide testing (S-005)

## Conclusion

The responsibility area mapping demonstrates systematic and comprehensive coverage of AxiomFramework's architecture. Each of the 8 identified domains has been assigned to a specialized worker with 5 focused requirements. The distribution ensures balanced workload, clear ownership, and complete framework coverage with no gaps or overlaps.
